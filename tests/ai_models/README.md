# AI Model Integration Tests

This directory contains tests for the AI model integration components of the pAIssive Income project.

## Test Coverage

### Model Fallback Tests (`test_model_fallback.py`)

These tests verify that the system can gracefully handle model failures and properly implement fallback strategies:

1. **Graceful Degradation with API Failures**
   - Tests that the system can continue functioning when a model API fails
   - Verifies that appropriate fallback models are selected
   - Ensures that fallback events are properly recorded

2. **Fallback Chain Behavior with Multiple Failures**
   - Tests the system's ability to handle multiple consecutive failures
   - Verifies that the fallback chain works correctly
   - Ensures that the system can find a working model after multiple failures

3. **Performance Impact of Fallback Scenarios**
   - Measures the performance impact of fallback operations
   - Verifies that the system remains functional despite performance changes
   - Ensures that fallback operations complete within reasonable time limits

### Model Version Compatibility Tests (`test_model_version_compatibility.py`)

These tests verify that the system can handle different model versions and properly manage version compatibility:

1. **Backward Compatibility with Older Model Versions**
   - Tests compatibility between different model versions
   - Verifies that semantic versioning rules are followed
   - Tests explicit compatibility declarations

2. **Handling of Model API Schema Changes**
   - Tests migration between different API schemas
   - Verifies that model behavior is preserved during migration
   - Tests multi-step migrations across multiple versions

3. **Version-Specific Feature Availability**
   - Tests feature detection across different model versions
   - Verifies that version-specific features are correctly identified
   - Ensures that feature requirements are properly checked
