### 4. Fixed WebhookService Issues
- ✅ Replaced the undefined `WEBHOOK_MAX_RETRIES_EXCEEDED` constant with a function call to `track_webhook_error`
- ✅ Added a test function to the webhook load test file to ensure it's properly collected by pytest

### 5. Added Missing Dependencies
- ✅ Added `prometheus_client` to the requirements.txt file
- ✅ Installed the dependency to fix test failures

### 6. Fixed Implementation Issues in Common Utils
- ✅ Fixed the `sanitize_filename` function to properly handle special characters
- ✅ Fixed the `sanitize_path` function to handle case sensitivity issues

### 7. Added Missing Test Data Functions
- ✅ Added `generate_monetization_strategy_data` function to `tests/api/utils/test_data.py`
- ✅ Added `generate_ui_component_data` function to `tests/api/utils/test_data.py`

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Fix API Test Client Fixture
- ✅ Created GraphQL-specific methods in the `APITestClient` class
- ✅ Updated GraphQL test files to use the new methods
- ✅ Fixed GraphQL test files to use `graphql_query` and `graphql_mutation` methods consistently

### 2. Fix Implementation Issues in Other Modules
- ✅ Fixed indentation issues in REST API route files
- ✅ Updated Pydantic models to use proper indentation with model_config
- ✅ Updated the code to match the expected interfaces in the tests
  - ✅ Fixed FallbackManager implementation to properly handle cascading fallback chains
  - ✅ Fixed SIZE_TIER strategy to handle None values for model size
  - ✅ Improved similar model strategy to ensure proper cascading to MODEL_TYPE

### 3. Address Additional Dependencies
- ✅ Fixed compatibility issues between FastAPI and Pydantic
- ✅ Identified and installed missing dependencies
  - ✅ Added httpx for FastAPI TestClient
  - ✅ Added flask for UI components
  - ✅ Added celery for background tasks
  - ✅ Added flask-socketio for UI WebSockets
  - ✅ Added pyjwt for authentication

### 4. Fix Test Configuration
- ✅ Fixed the pytest configuration warning by changing `python_paths` to `pythonpath`

### 5. Improve Test Coverage
- ✅ Added more tests to cover edge cases and improve overall test coverage
  - ✅ Added comprehensive API schema validation tests
  - ✅ Added service discovery tests
  - ✅ Added message queue tests

### 6. Fix Remaining Pydantic Warnings
- ✅ Created script to update Pydantic models to use the new V2 style
- ✅ Fixed warnings about using extra keyword arguments on `Field`
- ✅ Added `model_config = ConfigDict(protected_namespaces=())` to all models

## Next Steps

1. Run the full test suite to verify all fixes
2. Run GitHub Actions workflows locally to verify fixes
3. Update documentation to reflect the changes
4. Create a pull request with the fixes
5. Merge the changes into the main branch

## Conclusion

All identified issues have been successfully addressed. The following improvements have been made:

1. Fixed linting issues in various modules
2. Updated Pydantic models to V2 style with proper configuration
3. Fixed the API test client fixture to use GraphQL-specific methods consistently
4. Addressed implementation issues in the fallback strategy module
5. Added missing dependencies to requirements.txt
6. Improved test coverage with new tests for schema validation, service discovery, and message queues
7. Fixed test configuration issues

The codebase is now ready for a full test run and GitHub Actions workflow verification.
