# Tool Templates

This directory contains templates for developing AI-powered software tools for niche markets. These templates provide a starting point for implementing the solutions designed by the Developer Agent.

## Overview

The tool templates are organized into three main categories:

1. **Local AI Integration**: Templates for integrating local AI models into your applications
2. **UI Templates**: User interface templates for different types of applications
3. **Deployment Templates**: Templates for packaging and deploying your applications

## Local AI Integration

The `local_ai_integration.py` module provides templates for integrating local AI models into your applications. This includes:

- Loading and initializing local AI models
- Processing user input with AI models
- Caching and optimizing AI model responses
- Handling errors and fallbacks

## UI Templates

The `ui_templates.py` module provides user interface templates for different types of applications, including:

- Desktop applications (Electron)
- Web applications (React, Vue)
- Mobile applications (React Native)

Each template includes:

- Basic application structure
- UI components for common features
- State management
- User authentication
- Settings and preferences

## Deployment Templates

The `deployment_templates.py` module provides templates for packaging and deploying your applications, including:

- Desktop application packaging (Electron)
- Web application deployment (Netlify, Vercel)
- Mobile application deployment (App Store, Google Play)
- CI/CD pipelines

## Usage

To use these templates, copy the relevant files to your project and customize them according to your needs. Each template includes detailed comments and instructions for customization.

Example:

```python
from tool_templates.local_ai_integration import LocalAIModel

# Initialize a local AI model
model = LocalAIModel(
    model_path="path/to/model",
    model_type="text-generation",
    cache_enabled=True
)

# Generate text with the model
response = model.generate_text(
    prompt="Write a script for a YouTube video about AI tools",
    max_length=1000,
    temperature=0.7
)

print(response)
```

## Customization

Each template is designed to be customized for your specific niche and solution. Look for comments marked with `TODO` for guidance on what to customize.

## Dependencies

The templates have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- React 17+
- Electron 13+ (for desktop applications)
- React Native 0.64+ (for mobile applications)

Additional dependencies are listed in each template file.
