# Template 1: Local AI Project Definition & Feasibility

**(Purpose: Define the project scope and assess if local AI is the right approach.)**

**1. Project Idea:**
    *   **Project Name:** `[Your Project Name]`
    *   **Elevator Pitch (1-2 sentences):** `[Briefly describe the tool and its core value]`
    *   **Problem Solved:** `[What specific user problem or need does this address?]`
    *   **Target User:** `[Who is this tool for? (e.g., writers, developers, researchers, general public)]`

**2. Core AI Functionality:**
    *   **Primary AI Task:** `[e.g., Text Generation, Summarization, Code Generation, Image Generation, Transcription, Translation, Classification]`
    *   **Input Data:** `[What kind of data will the user provide? (e.g., text prompt, document, audio file, image)]`
    *   **Output Data:** `[What will the AI generate? (e.g., summarized text, Python code, PNG image, transcript)]`
    *   **Key Features Enabled by AI:** `[List specific features relying on the AI model]`

**3. Local AI Rationale & Feasibility:**
    *   **Why Local AI?** (Select all that apply & elaborate)
        *   [ ] **Privacy/Security:** `[Explain why data sensitivity necessitates local processing]`
        *   [ ] **Cost Savings:** `[Avoiding API fees is critical because...]`
        *   [ ] **Offline Capability:** `[The tool must function without internet because...]`
        *   [ ] **Control/Customization:** `[Need fine-grained control over the model/process]`
        *   [ ] **Performance (Specific Cases):** `[e.g., Low latency needed for real-time interaction, avoiding network lag]`
        *   [ ] **Other:** `[Specify]`
    *   **Feasibility Check:**
        *   **Suitable Local Models Available?** `[Yes/No/Maybe - List potential model families (e.g., Llama 3, Phi-3, Mistral, Stable Diffusion, Whisper)]`
        *   **Acceptable Performance on Target Hardware?** `[Yes/No/Maybe - Consider inference speed vs. user expectation]`
        *   **Manageable Model Size/Download?** `[Yes/No/Maybe - Are model file sizes reasonable for the target user?]`
        *   **Target Hardware Requirements (Estimate):**
            *   Minimum CPU: `[e.g., Modern multi-core]`
            *   Minimum RAM: `[e.g., 8GB, 16GB]`
            *   GPU Requirement: `[None / Optional (CPU fallback) / Recommended / Required]`
            *   Minimum VRAM (if GPU): `[e.g., 4GB, 6GB, 8GB+]`
        *   **User Setup Complexity:** `[Low/Medium/High - How difficult will installation and model setup be for the target user?]`

**4. Success Metrics:**
    *   `[How will you measure if the tool is successful? (e.g., Task completion rate, user satisfaction, speed, resource usage)]`

**5. Potential Monetization Strategy (Optional - relevant to pAIssive_income):**
    *   `[e.g., One-time purchase, freemium (basic local model free, advanced optional), donationware, sell pre-packaged workflows]`
