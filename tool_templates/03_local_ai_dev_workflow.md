# Template 3: Local AI Development Workflow

**(Purpose: Outline the steps for building, testing, and iterating on the tool.)**

**1. Environment Setup:**
    *   **Version Control:** `[Git Repository URL]`
    *   **Dependency Management:** `[e.g., Python venv + requirements.txt, Node.js + package.json, Conda environment.yml]`
    *   **AI Environment Setup:** `[Steps to install chosen inference engine (Ollama, llama.cpp build), GPU drivers (CUDA/ROCm), etc.]`

**2. Model Acquisition & Testing:**
    *   **Download Models:** `[Commands or process to get the selected model files]`
    *   **Initial Model Test:** `[Run basic inference using the engine's CLI or a simple script to confirm the model loads and generates output.]`
    *   **Performance Benchmarking (Basic):** `[Measure time-to-first-token, tokens/second on target hardware.]`

**3. Core Application Development:**
    *   `[Build the non-AI parts of the application (UI, file handling, settings, etc.)]`

**4. AI Integration:**
    *   `[Develop the code that prepares input data for the model (prompt engineering/formatting)]`
    *   `[Implement the logic to call the local AI inference engine/library]`
    *   `[Develop code to parse and utilize the model's output]`
    *   `[Implement user feedback mechanisms during long inference times (e.g., loading spinners, progress indicators)]`

**5. Prompt Engineering & Refinement:**
    *   **Initial Prompts:** `[Document the first set of prompts used]`
    *   **Testing & Iteration:** `[Describe the process for testing prompt effectiveness and refining them based on output quality.]`
    *   **Prompt Management:** `[How are prompts stored and managed? (e.g., Hardcoded, config files, user-customizable)]`

**6. Testing Strategy (Local Focus):**
    *   **Unit Tests:** `[Test individual functions (parsing, API calls, utility functions)]`
    *   **Integration Tests:** `[Test the interaction between the application logic and the local AI model/engine. Mocking the AI might be needed for speed.]`
    *   **End-to-End Tests:** `[Simulate user workflows on different hardware configurations if possible.]`
    *   **Performance Tests:** `[Measure application responsiveness, inference speed, and resource (RAM, VRAM, CPU) usage under typical load.]`
    *   **Robustness Tests:** `[Test edge cases: large inputs, invalid inputs, model loading failures, low memory conditions.]`
    *   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** `[Get feedback from target users, especially regarding performance and usability on their hardware.]`

**7. Build & Packaging:**
    *   **Build Process:** `[Steps to compile/bundle the application (e.g., using PyInstaller, Nuitka, Electron Builder, Cargo)]`
    *   **Packaging:** `[How will the app and potentially the model(s) be packaged? (e.g., Installer, ZIP archive, Docker image)]`
