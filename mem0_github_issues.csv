Investigate mem0 and its requirements,"- Read mem0's documentation for installation, configuration, and usage patterns.
- Clone the mem0 repo or decide how to integrate it (dependency, submodule, etc.).
- Identify core APIs, main classes, and data storage methods.
- List additional dependencies and services mem0 requires.",,mem0,,
Identify integration points in pAIssive_income,"- Locate where AI agents are defined (e.g. 'agent_team/', 'ai_models/', 'services/').
- Find existing agent memory logic, if any.
- Determine lifecycle hooks for memory recall/write (e.g., after each task, conversation turn, or planning step).",,mem0,,
Add mem0 to the codebase,"- Add mem0 to requirements (requirements.txt or setup.py).
- Install mem0 locally and verify compatibility.
- Ensure mem0 files are not in .gitignore.
- If using as submodule, update Docker/deployment scripts as needed.",,mem0,,
Design a memory adapter/wrapper service,"- Create a new service/utility class to abstract mem0 (e.g., services/memory_service.py).
- Configure storage location (file, db, etc.).
- Expose APIs like remember(), recall(), summarize_experiences().",,mem0,,
Integrate mem0 into agent logic,"- Inject memory recall at the start of agent reasoning/planning.
- Store new experiences (observations, actions, outcomes) after each agent cycle.
- Enable memory search/query during agent execution.",,mem0,,
Update data pipelines and interfaces,"- Update schemas/models if memory is exposed via APIs.
- Add endpoints for memory recall/inspection if useful.",,mem0,,
Test and validate memory integration,"- Write unit/integration tests for the memory service.
- Simulate agent tasks and verify memory recall/storage.
- Ensure test coverage and check for regressions.",,mem0,,
Document the new memory system,"- Document usage, configuration, and agent interaction with the new memory system.
- Update READMEs and docs.
- Add example agent scripts/notebooks demonstrating memory usage.",,mem0,,
Update deployment scripts and monitor performance,"- Update Dockerfiles/deployment scripts for mem0.
- Add migration/init scripts for memory storage if needed.
- Monitor memory usage and performance; profile as necessary.",,mem0,,
(Optional) Contribute improvements to mem0,"- If you extend mem0 for your needs, consider contributing improvements or bugfixes upstream.",,mem0,,
