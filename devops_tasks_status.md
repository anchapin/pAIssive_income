# DevOps Tasks Status

## Current Status

We've been working on fixing GitHub Actions workflow failures in the `devops_tasks` branch. Here's the current status:

### Fixed Issues
1. Fixed syntax errors in the `fix_test_collection_warnings.py` script:
   - Corrected duplicate code and indentation issues
   - Fixed docstring formatting
   - Properly indented function definitions and code blocks

2. Fixed syntax errors in the `dependency_container.py` file:
   - Removed duplicate code and fixed indentation issues
   - Fixed docstring formatting
   - Properly indented method definitions and code blocks

3. Modified the CI workflow to check Python files one by one:
   - Updated the workflow to process files individually rather than passing multiple files at once
   - This prevents errors when the script doesn't handle multiple file arguments correctly

### Pending Issues
1. Waiting for the latest workflow runs to complete:
   - The latest push with the CI workflow fix is still running
   - We need to verify that all workflows pass successfully

### Workflows Status

- **CI - Lint and Test**: In progress (latest run with dependency_container.py fix)
- **CI - Skip Syntax Check**: In progress (latest run with dependency_container.py fix)
- **Security Scan**: In progress (latest run with dependency_container.py fix)

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Workflow Success**:
   - Wait for the current workflow runs to complete
   - Check if all workflows pass successfully

2. **If Workflows Still Fail**:
   - Identify the specific failures in the workflow logs
   - Fix any remaining syntax errors in Python files
   - Update the CI workflow as needed

3. **Once All Workflows Pass**:
   - Create a pull request to merge the `devops_tasks` branch into `main`
   - Request a review of the changes
   - Merge the PR once approved

4. **Future Improvements**:
   - Enhance the `fix_test_collection_warnings.py` script to better handle multiple file arguments
   - Add more comprehensive syntax checking to catch errors earlier in the development process
   - Consider adding pre-commit hooks to prevent committing files with syntax errors

## Summary of Changes Made

1. Fixed syntax errors in multiple Python files:
   - `fix_test_collection_warnings.py`
   - `dependency_container.py`
   - Various schema files
   - Test files

2. Updated CI workflow to improve file processing:
   - Modified the file checking step to process files one by one
   - Added better error handling to prevent workflow failures

These changes should help ensure that the CI pipeline runs successfully and catches syntax errors early in the development process.
