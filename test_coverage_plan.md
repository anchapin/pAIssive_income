# pAIssive Income Test Coverage Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the pAIssive Income project, identifying existing test coverage and recommending additional tests to ensure robust functionality across all modules.

## Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage across all modules
2. **Modular Testing**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for interactions
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test boundary conditions, error states, and unexpected inputs
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance under various load conditions
5. **Mocking External Dependencies**: Use mock objects for external APIs and services

## Test Structure Overview

Tests are organized by module, with separate directories for unit tests, integration tests, and specialized test types. The primary test categories include:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
- **API Tests**: Testing REST/GraphQL API endpoints
- **UI Tests**: Testing user interfaces (web, CLI)
- **Performance Tests**: Testing system performance under load
- **Security Tests**: Testing for common vulnerabilities

## Current Test Coverage Status (May 5, 2025)

Overall Status: 386 passing tests, 1 skipped test
Target Coverage: >80% for all modules

## Test Implementation Schedule

### Week 1-2
- Complete statistical analysis framework
- Implement monetization module tests
- Begin API endpoint testing

### Week 3-4
- Complete API layer testing
- Implement UI component tests
- Begin security testing

### Week 5-6
- Complete security testing
- Implement performance tests
- Address any remaining gaps

## Quality Gates and Monitoring

1. **Pull Request Requirements**
   - All tests must pass
   - Coverage must not decrease
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - Performance benchmarks met

2. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Daily test execution
   - Weekly coverage reports
   - Monthly security scans

## Next Steps

1. Complete the in-progress statistical analysis framework
2. Begin implementation of monetization module tests
3. Start API endpoint test coverage
4. Schedule security audit and testing
5. Regular review and updates to this plan

Review this plan weekly and adjust priorities based on development needs.
