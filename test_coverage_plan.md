## Conclusion

The pAIssive Income test coverage plan has made significant progress, with all core modules now fully tested and meeting our coverage targets. The core functionality of AI Models, Monetization, Niche Analysis, Agent Team, Marketing, and UI/Frontend modules is well-covered with comprehensive tests including both REST and GraphQL APIs.

Current focus is on completing the remaining API/Service Layer tests, which are approximately 75% complete. The next priorities will be authentication/authorization testing and UI component testing.

The testing infrastructure is robust, with automated CI/CD integration for most test types and reliable test execution. We continue to improve our test coverage and quality through regular reviews and updates to this plan.

Key achievements:

- Increased overall test coverage from 75% to 85% in the past month
- Completed all monetization module tests
- Implemented comprehensive statistical analysis framework
- Established reliable API testing foundation
- Completed GraphQL API tests for all core modules

Next milestones:
