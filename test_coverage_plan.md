# pAIssive Income Test Coverage Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the pAIssive Income project, identifying existing test coverage and recommending additional tests to ensure robust functionality across all modules.

## Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage across all modules
2. **Modular Testing**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for interactions
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test boundary conditions, error states, and unexpected inputs
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance under various load conditions
5. **Mocking External Dependencies**: Use mock objects for external APIs and services

## Test Structure Overview

Tests are organized by module, with separate directories for unit tests, integration tests, and specialized test types. The primary test categories include:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
- **API Tests**: Testing REST/GraphQL API endpoints
- **UI Tests**: Testing user interfaces (web, CLI)
- **Performance Tests**: Testing system performance under load
- **Security Tests**: Testing for common vulnerabilities
