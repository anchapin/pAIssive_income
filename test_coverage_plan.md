# pAIssive Income Test Coverage Plan  ****

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the pAIssive Income project, identifying existing test coverage and recommending additional tests to ensure robust functionality across all modules.

## Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage across all modules
