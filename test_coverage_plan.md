# pAIssive Income Test Coverage Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the pAIssive Income project, identifying existing test coverage and recommending additional tests to ensure robust functionality across all modules.

## Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage across all modules
2. **Modular Testing**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for interactions
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test boundary conditions, error states, and unexpected inputs

Review this plan weekly and adjust priorities based on development needs.

## Conclusion

The pAIssive Income test coverage plan has made significant progress, with 5 of 8 modules now fully tested and meeting our coverage targets. The core functionality of AI Models, Monetization, Niche Analysis, Agent Team, and Marketing modules is well-covered with comprehensive tests.

Current focus is on completing the API/Service Layer tests, which are approximately 75% complete. The next priorities will be authentication/authorization testing and UI component testing.

The testing infrastructure is robust, with automated CI/CD integration for most test types and reliable test execution. We continue to improve our test coverage and quality through regular reviews and updates to this plan.

Key achievements:

- Increased overall test coverage from 75% to 85% in the past month
- Completed all monetization module tests
- Implemented comprehensive statistical analysis framework
- Established reliable API testing foundation

Next milestones:

- Complete API endpoint test coverage by end of Week 4
- Implement authentication and authorization tests by end of Week 5
- Begin UI component testing by end of Week 5
- Schedule comprehensive security audit for Week 6
=======
- **Deployment**:
  - Create deployment configuration for webhook service
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline for webhook service
  - Configure monitoring and alerting for production environment
