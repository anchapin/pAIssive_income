# pAIssive Income Test Coverage Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the pAIssive Income project, identifying existing test coverage and recommending additional tests to ensure robust functionality across all modules.

## Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage across all modules
2. **Modular Testing**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for interactions
