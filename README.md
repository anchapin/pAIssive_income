- **Monetization**: Subscription models and pricing strategies for maximizing recurring revenue.
- **Marketing**: Strategies for reaching target users and promoting the AI tools.

## Agent Team

The project is built around a team of specialized AI agents:

1. **Research Agent**: Identifies market opportunities and user needs in specific niches.
2. **Developer Agent**: Creates AI-powered software solutions to address identified needs.
3. **Monetization Agent**: Designs subscription models and pricing strategies.
4. **Marketing Agent**: Develops strategies for reaching and engaging target users.
5. **Feedback Agent**: Gathers and analyzes user feedback for product improvement.

## Key Features

- **Problem Analysis**: Detailed analysis of user problems and pain points to ensure solutions address real needs.
- **Solution Design**: Templates and frameworks for designing AI-powered software solutions.
- **Monetization Strategy**: Subscription models and pricing strategies optimized for recurring revenue.
- **Marketing Plan**: Comprehensive marketing strategies tailored to each niche and target user group.
- **Feedback Loop**: Tools for gathering and analyzing user feedback to continuously improve products.

## Example Niches

The framework has identified several promising niches for AI-powered tools:

1. **YouTube Script Generator**: AI tools to help YouTube creators write engaging scripts faster.
2. **Study Note Generator**: AI tools to help students create comprehensive study notes from lectures.
3. **Freelance Proposal Writer**: AI tools to help freelancers write compelling client proposals.
4. **Property Description Generator**: AI tools to help real estate agents write compelling property descriptions.
5. **Inventory Management for Small E-commerce**: AI tools to help small e-commerce businesses manage inventory efficiently.

## Getting Started

1. Run the niche analysis tools to identify promising market opportunities:

   ```python
   python main.py
   ```

2. Review the generated project plan:

   ```bash
   cat project_plan.json
   ```

3. Use the agent team to develop a comprehensive strategy for your chosen niche:

   ```python
   from agent_team import AgentTeam

   team = AgentTeam("Your Project Name")
   niches = team.run_niche_analysis(["your", "target", "segments"])
   solution = team.develop_solution(niches[0]["id"])
   monetization = team.create_monetization_strategy()
   marketing = team.create_marketing_plan()
   ```

4. Implement the AI tool using the provided templates in the `tool_templates` directory.

5. Deploy your monetization strategy based on the subscription models in the `monetization` directory.

6. Execute the marketing plan using strategies from the `marketing` directory.

7. Gather feedback and iterate on your product using the Feedback Agent.

## Example Output

Running the main script generates a complete project plan including:

- Niche analysis with opportunity scores
- Detailed user problem analysis
