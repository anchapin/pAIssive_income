## JavaScript Testing and Coverage

This project enforces at least **80% code coverage** for JavaScript files using [nyc (Istanbul)](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

### How to Run JavaScript Tests

Install dependencies (if not already done):

```sh
pnpm install
```

Run JavaScript tests and check coverage:

```sh
pnpm test
```

- If code coverage falls below 80%, the test run will fail.
- Coverage reports will be printed to the console and an HTML report will be generated in the `coverage/` directory (if running locally).

To generate a detailed lcov report:

```sh
pnpm coverage
```

**Coverage thresholds for statements, branches, functions, and lines are all set to 80%.**

You can find example JS source and tests in the `src/` directory.

---

## Writing Advanced JavaScript Tests (React Component Example)

For more complex JavaScript code, such as React components, you can write tests to verify rendering, user interaction, and state updates.

**Example: Testing a React Component with Mocha and Enzyme**

First, install additional test utilities:

```sh
pnpm add --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Example component (`src/Hello.js`):

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export function Hello({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;
}
```

Example test (`src/Hello.test.js`):

```js
const React = require('react');
const { shallow, configure } = require('enzyme');
const Adapter = require('@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17');
const { Hello } = require('./Hello');

configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });

describe('Hello component', () => {
  it('renders the correct greeting', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<Hello name="World" />);
    if (!wrapper.text().includes('Hello, World!')) {
      throw new Error('Greeting not rendered correctly');
    }
  });
});
```

> **Tip:** For React projects, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) is very popular and may offer a smoother setup for component and hook testing.

**Best Practices:**
- Test both rendering and user events/interactions.
- Mock API calls and external dependencies.
- Use coverage reports to identify untested code paths.
- Place tests next to source files or in a dedicated test directory.

## Dependency Updates (via Dependabot)

This project uses [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to keep dependencies up-to-date for all major ecosystems:

- **JavaScript/Node (pnpm):** Updates to packages in `package.json`
- **Python:** Updates to packages in `requirements-ci.txt`, `requirements_filtered.txt`
- **Docker:** Updates to base images in `Dockerfile`, `main_Dockerfile`, and `ui/react_frontend/Dockerfile.dev`
- **GitHub Actions:** Updates to workflow actions in `.github/workflows/`

**How it works:**
- Dependabot will automatically open pull requests for version updates on a weekly schedule.
- PRs are labeled by ecosystem (e.g., `dependencies`, `javascript`, `python`, `docker`, `github-actions`).
- Some dependencies (e.g., `react`, `flask`, `pytest`) will not be updated for major releases automatically.

**Maintainer action:**
- Review Dependabot PRs promptly.
- Ensure CI/tests pass before merging.
- For major upgrades, review changelogs for breaking changes.

For more details, see `.github/dependabot.yml`.

> **Tip for maintainers:**
> Periodically review and adjust the `.github/dependabot.yml` configuration (update schedules, ignored dependencies, PR limits) to ensure it fits the project's evolving needs.

## Docker Compose Integration
=======
For any questions, see the [FAQ](docs/07_troubleshooting_and_faq/faq.md) or open an issue.

**pAIssive Income** is a modular, extensible platform for AI-powered content generation, market analysis, monetization, automation, and more. It features advanced agent orchestration, robust APIs, secure development practices, and a developer-friendly workflow. The project is organized for clarity, maintainability, and rapid onboarding.

---

> **Tip:** To enable advanced build graph features (Compose BuildKit Bake), set `COMPOSE_BAKE=true` in your `.env` file.
> This requires Docker Compose v2.10+ and will use the BuildKit bake engine for improved build performance and caching.

For more details on the Docker Compose integration and Compose Bake, see [DOCKER_COMPOSE.md](DOCKER_COMPOSE.md).

## CrewAI + CopilotKit Integration

This project includes integration with CrewAI and CopilotKit to enable powerful multi-agent AI features in the React frontend.

### Features

- **Agentic Chat**: Chat with AI copilots and call frontend tools
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Collaborate with the AI, plan tasks, and decide actions interactively
- **Agentic/Generative UI**: Assign long-running tasks to agents and see real-time progress

### Usage

To use the CrewAI + CopilotKit integration:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Backend (CrewAI)
   pip install '.[agents]'

   # Frontend (CopilotKit)
   cd ui/react_frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   # Using Docker Compose
   docker compose up --build

   # Or manually
   python app.py
   ```

## mem0 Memory Integration

This project includes integration with [mem0](https://mem0.ai), a memory layer for AI agents that enables persistent memory capabilities across conversations and sessions.

### Features

- **Persistent Memory**: Agents remember user preferences, past interactions, and important information
- **Memory Search**: Retrieve relevant memories based on context and queries
- **Conversation Storage**: Store entire conversations for future reference
- **Memory-Enhanced Agents**: Both ADK and CrewAI agents are enhanced with memory capabilities

### Usage

To use the mem0 integration:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key (required by mem0):
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'

   # Windows (Command Prompt)
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. Use memory-enhanced agents in your code:
   ```python
   # For ADK agents
   from adk_demo.mem0_enhanced_adk_agents import MemoryEnhancedDataGathererAgent

   agent = MemoryEnhancedDataGathererAgent(name="DataGatherer", user_id="user123")

   # For CrewAI agents
   from agent_team.mem0_enhanced_agents import MemoryEnhancedCrewAIAgentTeam

   team = MemoryEnhancedCrewAIAgentTeam(user_id="user123")
   ```

## Agentic Reasoning Tests & Benchmarking

This project now includes advanced tests and benchmarking for agentic reasoning and tool use:

- **Agentic Reasoning Unit Tests:**
  - See `tests/test_artist_agent.py` for tests validating the ability of agents to select and use tools (such as the calculator) and to handle multi-step reasoning prompts.
- **Benchmarking:**
  - See `tests/performance/test_artist_agent_benchmark.py` for automated benchmarking of the ARTIST agent against other agent frameworks.
  - Benchmark results are output to `tests/performance/artist_agent_benchmark.md` after running the benchmark script.

These additions help ensure robust, measurable progress in agentic reasoning and tool integration in this codebase.
