> **Tip:** To enable advanced build graph features (Compose BuildKit Bake), set `COMPOSE_BAKE=true` in your `.env` file.
> This requires Docker Compose v2.10+ and will use the BuildKit bake engine for improved build performance and caching.

For more details on the Docker Compose integration and Compose Bake, see [DOCKER_COMPOSE.md](DOCKER_COMPOSE.md).

## CrewAI + CopilotKit Integration

This project includes integration with CrewAI and CopilotKit to enable powerful multi-agent AI features in the React frontend.

### Features

- **Agentic Chat**: Chat with AI copilots and call frontend tools
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Collaborate with the AI, plan tasks, and decide actions interactively
- **Agentic/Generative UI**: Assign long-running tasks to agents and see real-time progress

### Usage

To use the CrewAI + CopilotKit integration:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Backend (CrewAI)
   pip install '.[agents]'

   # Frontend (CopilotKit)
   cd ui/react_frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   # Using Docker Compose
   docker compose up --build

   # Or manually
   python app.py
   ```
