ARTIST Experiments
==================

The ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-improving Transformers) experiments demonstrate advanced agentic reasoning, reinforcement learning, and dynamic tool integration for LLMs.

- For setup instructions, detailed experiment descriptions, and dependencies, see the full [ARTIST Experiments README](../../artist_experiments/README.md).
- Recent updates include a 'Feedback & Iterative Improvements' section that documents user/developer feedback and tracks ongoing enhancements to the ARTIST agent logic, tool coverage, and RL training.

Key experiments:
- Enhanced Mathematical Problem-Solving (RL for multi-step math)
- Multi-API Orchestration for Market Research

Feedback and improvement history are maintained transparently in the ARTIST Experiments README for review by users and contributors.
