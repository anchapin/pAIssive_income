#   - Runs on: Ubuntu, Windows, MacOS
#   - Performs: linting (ruff), type checking (mypy), testing (pytest)
#   - Generates: test reports and coverage data
#
# - security: Comprehensive security scanning
#   - Runs on: Ubuntu, Windows, MacOS
#   - Tools: Safety, Bandit, Trivy, Semgrep, pip-audit, Gitleaks
#   - Generates: SARIF reports and security artifacts
#
# - build-deploy: Docker image building and publishing
#   - Runs on: Ubuntu only (for Docker compatibility)
#   - Triggers: On main/dev branch pushes and version tags
#   - Handles: Docker image building, caching, and publishing
