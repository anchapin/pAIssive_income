# CopilotKit + CrewAI Integration Guide

CopilotKit + CrewAI lets you bring powerful multi-agent AI features into your React application. This enables:

- **Agentic Chat**: Chat with AI copilots and call frontend tools
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Collaborate with the AI, plan tasks, and decide actions interactively
- **Agentic/Generative UI**: Assign long-running tasks to agents and see real-time progress
- **Collaborative State**: Edit documents or data collaboratively with AI agents
- **Tool-Based Workflows**: Integrate custom tool actions into agent-driven UIs

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize CopilotKit + CrewAI**

Open a terminal in this directory and run:

```sh
npx copilotkit@latest init -m CrewAI
