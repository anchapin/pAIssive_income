# Authentication and Authorization System Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for the authentication and authorization system for the pAIssive_income project. The system will provide secure user authentication, role-based access control, and session management.

## Components

### 1. Authentication

#### 1.1 User Registration
- Users can register with username, email, password, and name
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt
- Email verification (optional enhancement)
- Prevention of duplicate usernames and emails
- Input validation for all fields

#### 1.2 User Login
- Authentication using username/password
- JWT token generation for authenticated sessions
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism
- Failed login attempt tracking and rate limiting
- Remember me functionality

#### 1.3 Password Management
- Password reset via email
- Password change functionality
- Password strength requirements
- Password history to prevent reuse

### 2. Authorization

#### 2.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Predefined roles: user, creator, admin, etc.
- Each role has a set of permissions
- Permissions are resource-action pairs (e.g., "niche:view")
- Permission levels (view, edit, create, delete, admin)

#### 2.2 Permission Checking
- Middleware for checking permissions on API routes
- UI components that conditionally render based on permissions
- Permission inheritance (admin role inherits all permissions)

#### 2.3 Resource Ownership
- Users can own resources (niches, solutions, etc.)
- Special permissions for resource owners
- Ability to share resources with other users

### 3. Session Management

#### 3.1 Token-Based Sessions
- JWT tokens for maintaining sessions
- Token storage in browser (localStorage/cookies)
- Token refresh mechanism
- Secure token handling

#### 3.2 Session Monitoring
- Active session tracking
- Ability to view and terminate sessions
- Session timeout settings
- Concurrent session limits (optional)

### 4. Security Features

#### 4.1 Audit Logging
- Logging of authentication events
- Logging of authorization events
- Logging of security-related actions
- Audit log viewing for administrators

#### 4.2 Security Headers
- Implementation of security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- CSRF protection
- XSS protection
- Content-Security-Policy implementation

#### 4.3 Rate Limiting
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Rate limiting for API requests
- IP-based blocking for suspicious activity

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Authentication
1. Implement user registration with validation
2. Implement login functionality with JWT
3. Implement password management features
4. Add security headers and CSRF protection

### Phase 2: Authorization System
1. Implement role and permission models
2. Create middleware for permission checking
3. Implement resource ownership model
4. Add UI components for permission-based rendering

### Phase 3: Session Management
1. Implement token refresh mechanism
2. Add session monitoring features
3. Implement session termination
4. Add concurrent session management

### Phase 4: Security Enhancements
1. Implement audit logging
2. Add rate limiting
3. Implement suspicious activity detection
4. Add security monitoring dashboard

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate a user
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Log out a user
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh an authentication token
- `POST /api/auth/password/reset` - Request a password reset
- `POST /api/auth/password/reset/:token` - Reset password with token
- `PUT /api/auth/password` - Change password (authenticated)

### User Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/user/profile` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/user/profile` - Update user profile
- `GET /api/users` - List users (admin only)
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID (admin only)
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user (admin only)

### Role Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/roles` - List all roles (admin only)
- `POST /api/roles` - Create a new role (admin only)
- `PUT /api/roles/:id` - Update a role (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/roles/:id` - Delete a role (admin only)
- `PUT /api/users/:id/roles` - Assign roles to a user (admin only)

### Session Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/sessions` - List active sessions for current user
- `DELETE /api/sessions/:id` - Terminate a session
- `GET /api/admin/sessions` - List all active sessions (admin only)

## UI Components

### Authentication Components
- Login form
- Registration form
- Password reset form
- Password change form

### User Management Components
- User profile page
- User settings page
- User list (admin)
- User detail (admin)

### Role Management Components
- Role list (admin)
- Role editor (admin)
- Permission assignment (admin)

### Session Management Components
- Active sessions list
- Session termination button

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**
   - Short expiration times for tokens
   - Secure storage of tokens
   - Token invalidation on logout

2. **Password Security**
   - Strong password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Password strength requirements
   - Account lockout after failed attempts

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption of sensitive data
   - Minimal exposure of user data
   - Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - HTTPS for all communications
   - Proper configuration of security headers
   - Regular security audits

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test authentication functions
   - Test authorization functions
   - Test password hashing and verification

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test authorization flow
   - Test session management

3. **Security Tests**
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Test rate limiting
   - Test brute force protection

4. **UI Tests**
   - Test authentication forms
   - Test permission-based UI rendering
   - Test user management interfaces
