# Niche Analysis

The Niche Analysis module is a key component of the pAIssive Income Framework. It provides tools for analyzing market segments and identifying profitable niches for AI-powered software tools.

## Overview

The Niche Analysis module consists of three main components:

1. **Market Analyzer**: Analyzes market segments to identify potential niches.
2. **Problem Identifier**: Identifies user problems and pain points in specific niches.
3. **Opportunity Scorer**: Scores niche opportunities based on various factors.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive analysis of market segments and identify the most promising niches for AI-powered software tools.

## Market Analyzer

The `MarketAnalyzer` class is responsible for analyzing market segments to identify potential niches. It provides methods for:

- Analyzing market segments to identify potential niches
- Analyzing competition in specific niches
- Analyzing trends in market segments
- Identifying target users for specific niches

```python
from niche_analysis import MarketAnalyzer

# Create a market analyzer
analyzer = MarketAnalyzer()

# Analyze a market segment
segment_analysis = analyzer.analyze_segment("e-commerce")

# Analyze competition in a niche
competition_analysis = analyzer.analyze_competition("inventory management for small e-commerce")

# Analyze trends in a market segment
trend_analysis = analyzer.analyze_trends("e-commerce")
```

### Segment Analysis

The `analyze_segment` method returns a dictionary with information about the market segment, including:

## Integration with Agent Team

The Niche Analysis module is integrated with the Agent Team module through the Researcher Agent. The Researcher Agent uses the Market Analyzer, Problem Identifier, and Opportunity Scorer to identify profitable niches.

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam

# Create a team
team = AgentTeam("Niche AI Tools")

# Run niche analysis
niches = team.run_niche_analysis(["e-commerce", "content creation"])

# Print identified niches
for i, niche in enumerate(niches):
    print(f"{i+1}. {niche['name']} (Score: {niche['opportunity_score']:.2f})")
```

## Example: Complete Niche Analysis

Here's a complete example that demonstrates how to use the Niche Analysis module:

```python
from niche_analysis import MarketAnalyzer, ProblemIdentifier, OpportunityScorer

# Create the components
market_analyzer = MarketAnalyzer()
problem_identifier = ProblemIdentifier()
opportunity_scorer = OpportunityScorer()

# Define market segments to analyze
market_segments = [
    "e-commerce",
    "content creation",
    "freelancing",
    "education",
    "real estate",
]

# Analyze each segment
opportunities = []
for segment in market_segments:
    # Analyze the segment
    segment_analysis = market_analyzer.analyze_segment(segment)
    
    # Get potential niches
    potential_niches = segment_analysis.get("potential_niches", [])
    
    # Analyze each potential niche
    for niche in potential_niches:
        # Analyze market data for the niche
        market_data = market_analyzer.analyze_competition(niche)
        
        # Identify problems in the niche
        problems = problem_identifier.identify_problems(niche)
        
        # Score the opportunity
        opportunity = opportunity_scorer.score_opportunity(niche, market_data, problems)
        
        # Add to opportunities list
        opportunities.append(opportunity)

# Compare opportunities
comparison = opportunity_scorer.compare_opportunities(opportunities)

# Print top recommendations
top_recommendations = comparison.get("ranked_opportunities", [])[:3]
print("Top 3 Recommendations:")
for i, recommendation in enumerate(top_recommendations):
    print(f"{i+1}. {recommendation['niche']} (Score: {recommendation['overall_score']:.2f})")
```
