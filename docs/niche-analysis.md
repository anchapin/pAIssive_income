# Niche Analysis

The Niche Analysis module is a key component of the pAIssive Income Framework. It provides tools for analyzing market segments and identifying profitable niches for AI-powered software tools.

## Overview

The Niche Analysis module consists of three main components:

1. **Market Analyzer**: Analyzes market segments to identify potential niches.
2. **Problem Identifier**: Identifies user problems and pain points in specific niches.
3. **Opportunity Scorer**: Scores niche opportunities based on various factors.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive analysis of market segments and identify the most promising niches for AI-powered software tools.

# Analyze a market segment
segment_analysis = analyzer.analyze_segment("e-commerce")

# Analyze competition in a niche
competition_analysis = analyzer.analyze_competition("inventory management for small e-commerce")

# Analyze trends in a market segment
trend_analysis = analyzer.analyze_trends("e-commerce")

### Opportunity Scoring Mathematical Model

The opportunity scoring algorithm uses a weighted sum model to calculate the overall opportunity score. This section details the mathematical foundations of this scoring approach.

#### Factor Score Calculation

Each factor is scored on a normalized scale between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the lowest possible value and 1 represents the highest possible value.

For qualitative factors like market size, growth rate, and competition, the algorithm maps categorical values to numerical scores:

| Factor | Category | Numerical Score |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Market Size | Large | 0.9 |
| | Medium | 0.6 |
| | Small | 0.3 |
| | Unknown | 0.5 |
| Growth Rate | High | 0.9 |
| | Medium | 0.6 |
| | Low | 0.3 |
| | Unknown | 0.5 |
| Competition | Low | 0.9 |
| | Medium | 0.5 |
| | High | 0.2 |
| | Unknown | 0.5 |

For quantitative factors like problem severity, solution feasibility, and monetization potential, more complex algorithms are used:

1. **Problem Severity Score**: Calculated as the average severity of identified problems.

   Given a set of problems P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} with respective severities S = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ} where s ∈ {high=1.0, medium=0.6, low=0.3}, the problem severity score is:

   PS = (∑ᵢ sᵢ) / n, where n is the number of problems.

2. **Solution Feasibility Score**: Starts with a base score of 0.7, which is adjusted based on niche characteristics:

   SF = min(max(0.7 + text_content_bonus + data_bonus, 0), 1)

   Where:
   - text_content_bonus = 0.2 if the niche contains keywords related to text/content (e.g., "writing", "content")
   - data_bonus = 0.1 if the niche contains keywords related to data processing (e.g., "analytics", "reporting")

3. **Monetization Potential Score**: Starts with a base score of 0.5, adjusted by multiple factors:

   MP = min(max(0.5 + market_bonus + growth_bonus + severity_bonus + business_bonus, 0), 1)

   Where:
   - market_bonus = 0.2 for large markets, 0.1 for medium markets, -0.1 for small markets
   - growth_bonus = 0.2 for high growth, 0.1 for medium growth, -0.1 for low growth
   - severity_bonus = 0.1 if problem severity score > 0.7
   - business_bonus = 0.1 if the niche contains keywords related to business (e.g., "business", "enterprise")

#### Weighted Sum Model

The overall opportunity score is calculated as a weighted sum of the individual factor scores:

OS = ∑ᵢ (wᵢ × fᵢ)

Where:
- OS is the overall opportunity score
- wᵢ is the weight for factor i
- fᵢ is the score for factor i
- ∑ᵢ wᵢ = 1 (weights sum to 1)

The default weights are:
- Market Size: 0.2
- Growth Rate: 0.15
- Competition: 0.15
- Problem Severity: 0.2
- Solution Feasibility: 0.15
- Monetization Potential: 0.15

#### Score Interpretation

The overall score is interpreted as follows:

| Score Range | Assessment | Recommendations |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 0.8 - 1.0 | Excellent opportunity with high potential | High priority, significant resources |
| 0.6 - 0.79 | Very good opportunity worth pursuing | Medium-high priority, appropriate resources |
| 0.4 - 0.59 | Good opportunity with moderate potential | Medium priority, moderate resources |
| 0.2 - 0.39 | Fair opportunity with limited potential | Caution, limited exploration |
| 0.0 - 0.19 | Limited opportunity with minimal potential | Deprioritize, consider alternatives |

#### Opportunity Comparison Algorithm

When comparing multiple opportunities, the comparison algorithm:

1. Sorts opportunities by their overall score in descending order.
2. Assigns ranks based on sorted position (1 for highest score).
3. Calculates score distribution statistics:
   - Highest score: max(scores)
   - Lowest score: min(scores)
   - Average score: mean(scores)
   - Distribution of scores by category (excellent, very good, good, fair, limited)
4. Identifies the top recommendation (highest-scoring opportunity).
5. Generates comparative recommendations based on the distribution of scores.

This algorithm enables data-driven decisions about which niches to prioritize for AI solution development.

## Integration with Agent Team

The Niche Analysis module is integrated with the Agent Team module through the Researcher Agent. The Researcher Agent uses the Market Analyzer, Problem Identifier, and Opportunity Scorer to identify profitable niches.

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam

# Create a team
team = AgentTeam("Niche AI Tools")

# Run niche analysis
niches = team.run_niche_analysis(["e-commerce", "content creation"])

# Print identified niches
for i, niche in enumerate(niches):
    print(f"{i+1}. {niche['name']} (Score: {niche['opportunity_score']:.2f})")
```

## Example: Complete Niche Analysis

Here's a complete example that demonstrates how to use the Niche Analysis module:

```python
from niche_analysis import MarketAnalyzer, ProblemIdentifier, OpportunityScorer

# Create the components
market_analyzer = MarketAnalyzer()
problem_identifier = ProblemIdentifier()
opportunity_scorer = OpportunityScorer()

# Define market segments to analyze
market_segments = [
    "e-commerce",
    "content creation",
    "freelancing",
    "education",
    "real estate",
]

# Analyze each segment
opportunities = []
for segment in market_segments:
    # Analyze the segment
    segment_analysis = market_analyzer.analyze_segment(segment)

    # Get potential niches
    potential_niches = segment_analysis.get("potential_niches", [])

    # Analyze each potential niche
    for niche in potential_niches:
        # Analyze market data for the niche
        market_data = market_analyzer.analyze_competition(niche)

        # Identify problems in the niche
        problems = problem_identifier.identify_problems(niche)

        # Score the opportunity
        opportunity = opportunity_scorer.score_opportunity(niche, market_data, problems)

        # Add to opportunities list
        opportunities.append(opportunity)

# Compare opportunities
comparison = opportunity_scorer.compare_opportunities(opportunities)

# Print top recommendations
top_recommendations = comparison.get("ranked_opportunities", [])[:3]
print("Top 3 Recommendations:")
for i, recommendation in enumerate(top_recommendations):
    print(f"{i+1}. {recommendation['niche']} (Score: {recommendation['overall_score']:.2f})")
```
