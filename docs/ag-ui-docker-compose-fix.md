# AG-UI Docker Compose Integration Fix

This document provides information about the fixes implemented to resolve Docker Compose integration issues with the AG-UI integration.

## Overview

The integration of AG-UI into the React frontend caused issues with the Docker Compose workflow in GitHub Actions. The following issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Docker Network Creation Issues**: The workflow was failing to create the Docker network.
2. **Docker Compose Version Compatibility**: There were issues with the Docker Compose version being used.
3. **Frontend Integration Issues**: The PR added a React frontend with ag-ui integration, which was causing compatibility issues.
4. **Docker Image Pulling Issues**: There were issues with pulling the required Docker images.

## Solution Components

The solution includes the following components:

### 1. Fixed Workflow Files

- `.github/workflows/docker-compose-integration-fixed-ag-ui.yml`: A fixed version of the Docker Compose integration workflow with improved error handling and retry logic.
- `.github/workflows/test-docker-compose-ag-ui-fix.yml`: A workflow to test the Docker Compose fix.

### 2. Helper Scripts

- `scripts/fix-docker-network.sh`: A script to fix Docker network issues.
- `scripts/fix-docker-compose.sh`: A script to fix Docker Compose issues.
- `scripts/run-docker-compose-ci.sh`: A script to run Docker Compose in CI environments.

### 3. Configuration Files

- `docker-compose.yml`: Updated with improved network configuration and CI compatibility.
- `docker-compose.ci.yml`: A CI-specific override file with optimized settings for GitHub Actions.
- `ui/react_frontend/Dockerfile.dev`: Updated to properly handle ag-ui dependencies.

## Key Fixes

### 1. Docker Network Creation

The Docker network creation was fixed by:
- Adding explicit network creation steps with error handling
- Ensuring the network is created before starting services
- Adding network inspection for debugging

### 2. Docker Compose Configuration

The Docker Compose configuration was fixed by:
- Adding compatibility checks for different Docker Compose versions
- Implementing fallback mechanisms for Docker Compose commands
- Adding validation of the docker-compose.yml file

### 3. Frontend Integration

The frontend integration was fixed by:
- Ensuring proper volume mounting for node_modules
- Adding proper configuration for ag-ui dependencies
- Implementing fallback mechanisms for Node.js images

### 4. Docker Image Pulling

The Docker image pulling was fixed by:
- Adding retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implementing fallback mechanisms for different image versions
- Adding detailed logging for debugging

## Usage

To use the fixed workflow:

1. Run the Docker network fix script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/fix-docker-network.sh
   ```

2. Run the Docker Compose fix script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/fix-docker-compose.sh
   ```

3. Run the Docker Compose CI script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-docker-compose-ci.sh
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Docker Compose integration:

1. Check the Docker network:
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   docker network inspect paissive-network
   ```

2. Check the Docker Compose configuration:
   ```bash
   docker compose config
   ```

3. Check the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

4. Check the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

5. Check the Docker logs:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs
   ```

## Conclusion

The fixes implemented in this solution address the issues with the Docker Compose integration for the AG-UI integration. The solution provides robust error handling, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms to ensure the workflow runs successfully in GitHub Actions.
