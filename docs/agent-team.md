# Agent Team

The Agent Team module is a core component of the pAIssive Income Framework. It provides a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate on developing and monetizing niche AI tools for passive income generation.

---

## Overview

The Agent Team consists of five specialized agents:

1. **Researcher Agent**: Analyzes market segments and identifies profitable niches.
2. **Developer Agent**: Designs and develops AI-powered solutions for specific niches.
3. **Monetization Agent**: Creates monetization strategies with subscription models.
4. **Marketing Agent**: Develops marketing strategies and content for target users.
5. **Feedback Agent**: Collects and analyzes user feedback to improve solutions.

These agents work together in a coordinated workflow to take a project from initial market research to a fully developed, monetized, and marketed AI tool.

## Agentic Reasoning and Autonomous Tool Selection

### Metadata-Driven Tool Selection

The `CrewAIAgentTeam` (and compatible agent team classes) now support advanced agentic reasoning and autonomous tool selection. This is built on the extensible tool registry (see [Common Utils Tooling](common-utils-tooling.md)), where each tool is registered with metadata such as:

- **keywords**: List of descriptive terms for matching user or agent intent.
- **input_preprocessor**: Function to prepare or adapt raw task input for the tool.

When an agent (or the team) is assigned a task, it uses agentic reasoning to:

1. **Match the Task to a Tool**: The agent analyzes the task description and matches it to a registered tool by comparing task-relevant keywords to those provided in each tool's metadata.
2. **Prepare Input**: If the selected tool defines an `input_preprocessor`, the agent runs the raw task input through the preprocessor to generate the correct input structure for the tool.
3. **Invoke the Tool**: The tool is invoked autonomously, and results are integrated back into the agent's workflow.

This system allows both built-in and custom tools to be used seamlessly, with agents able to discover, select, and invoke tools purely from their metadata.

---

### Registering and Extending Tools

To add new capabilities to your agent team, simply register a tool with keywords and (optionally) an input preprocessor:

```python
from common_utils import tooling

def summarize_text(text: str, max_sentences: int = 3) -> str:
    """Summarize a text into the given number of sentences."""
    # Dummy example logic
    sentences = text.split(".")
    return ". ".join(sentences[:max_sentences]) + "."

tooling.register_tool(
    name="summarize",
    func=summarize_text,
    keywords=["summarize", "summary", "text", "shorten", "condense"],
    input_preprocessor=lambda user_input: {
        "text": user_input if isinstance(user_input, str) else user_input.get("text"),
        "max_sentences": 2
    }
)
```

Tools can be registered at any time before or during the lifetime of the agent team. All agents on the team will automatically consider new tools in their reasoning.

---

### Usage Example: Autonomous Tool Selection in Action

Below is an example showing a team, a task, and how a tool is selected and invoked using metadata-driven reasoning and input preprocessing:

```python
from agent_team import CrewAIAgentTeam
from common_utils import tooling

# Register a calculator tool with keywords and an input preprocessor
def calculator(expression: str) -> float:
    """Evaluate a mathematical expression."""
    return eval(expression, {"__builtins__": None}, {})

tooling.register_tool(
    name="calculator",
    func=calculator,
    keywords=["calculate", "math", "arithmetic", "expression", "evaluate"],
    input_preprocessor=lambda s: {"expression": s.strip()}
)

# Create a team
team = CrewAIAgentTeam("Autonomous Team")

# Assign a task that implies calculation
task = "Please calculate the result of 5 * (3 + 2)."

# The agent team will:
# 1. Match 'calculate'/'calculation' in the task to the calculator tool by keywords
# 2. Use the input_preprocessor to structure the input
# 3. Invoke the calculator tool autonomously

result = team.assign_task(task)  # This will trigger autonomous tool selection and invocation
print("Result:", result)
```

In this example, the agent team will automatically select the `calculator` tool based on the task's language, preprocess the input as needed, and invoke the tool â€“ all without explicit user intervention.

---

### Logging: Agentic Reasoning and Tool Invocations

All agentic reasoning steps (such as tool selection, input preparation, and invocation results) are logged to the `agentic_reasoning` logger for transparency and debugging. Log messages include:

- Which tool was selected for a task and why (keyword match info)
- How the input was preprocessed before invocation
- Tool invocation results and any errors

**Note:** Logging configuration (handlers, levels, output destinations) is now left to the application using the framework. To capture or format agentic reasoning logs, configure the `agentic_reasoning` logger using standard Python or your preferred logging setup.

---

## AgentTeam Class

The `AgentTeam` class is the main entry point for working with the agent team. It manages the team's configuration, state, and workflow.

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam

# Create a team with default configuration
team = AgentTeam("My Team")

# Create a team with custom configuration
team = AgentTeam("My Team", config_path="path/to/config.json")
```

### Configuration

The `AgentTeam` class can be configured with a JSON configuration file. The configuration includes:

- **Model Settings**: AI model settings for each agent (model name, temperature, etc.)
- **Workflow Settings**: Settings for the team's workflow (auto progression, review required, etc.)

Example configuration:

```json
{
    "model_settings": {
        "researcher": {"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.7},
        "developer": {"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.2},
        "monetization": {"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.5},
        "marketing": {"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.8},
        "feedback": {"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.3}
    },
    "workflow": {
        "auto_progression": false,
        "review_required": true
    }
}
```

### Project State

The `AgentTeam` class maintains a project state that tracks the progress of the project. The project state includes:

- **Identified Niches**: Niches identified by the Researcher Agent
- **Selected Niche**: The niche selected for development
- **User Problems**: User problems identified by the Researcher Agent
- **Solution Design**: Solution design created by the Developer Agent
- **Development Plan**: Development plan created by the Developer Agent
- **Monetization Strategy**: Monetization strategy created by the Monetization Agent
- **Marketing Campaign**: Marketing campaign created by the Marketing Agent
- **User Feedback**: User feedback collected by the Feedback Agent

# Create a developer agent
developer = DeveloperAgent()

# Design a solution
solution = developer.design_solution(niche)

# Create a development plan
plan = developer.create_development_plan(solution)

# Implement a solution
implementation = developer.implement_solution(solution, plan)
```

### Monetization Agent

The Monetization Agent is responsible for creating monetization strategies with subscription models. It uses AI to:

- Create subscription models with different tiers and features
- Calculate optimal pricing for each tier
- Project revenue based on different scenarios
- Optimize monetization strategies for maximum revenue

```python
from agent_team import MonetizationAgent

# Create a monetization agent
monetization = MonetizationAgent()

# Create a monetization strategy
strategy = monetization.create_strategy(solution)

# Calculate pricing
pricing = monetization.calculate_pricing(strategy)

# Project revenue
projection = monetization.project_revenue(strategy, pricing)
```

### Marketing Agent

The Marketing Agent is responsible for developing marketing strategies and content for target users. It uses AI to:

- Create user personas for target users
- Develop marketing strategies for different channels
- Generate marketing content for various platforms
- Optimize content for maximum engagement

```python
from agent_team import MarketingAgent

# Create a marketing agent
marketing = MarketingAgent()

# Create user personas
personas = marketing.create_personas(solution)

# Develop a marketing strategy
strategy = marketing.develop_strategy(solution, personas)

# Generate marketing content
content = marketing.generate_content(strategy)
```

### Feedback Agent

The Feedback Agent is responsible for collecting and analyzing user feedback to improve solutions. It uses AI to:

- Collect feedback from users
- Analyze feedback to identify patterns and insights
- Generate improvement recommendations
- Track user satisfaction over time

```python
from agent_team import FeedbackAgent

# Create a feedback agent
feedback = FeedbackAgent()

# Collect feedback
user_feedback = feedback.collect_feedback(solution)

# Analyze feedback
analysis = feedback.analyze_feedback(user_feedback)

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = feedback.generate_recommendations(analysis)
```

---

## Workflow

The typical workflow for using the Agent Team is as follows:

1. **Create a Team**: Create an `AgentTeam` instance with a name and optional configuration.
2. **Run Niche Analysis**: Use the Researcher Agent to identify profitable niches.
3. **Select a Niche**: Select a niche from the identified niches.
4. **Develop a Solution**: Use the Developer Agent to design and develop a solution.
5. **Create a Monetization Strategy**: Use the Monetization Agent to create a monetization strategy.
6. **Create a Marketing Campaign**: Use the Marketing Agent to create a marketing campaign.
7. **Collect and Analyze Feedback**: Use the Feedback Agent to collect and analyze user feedback.
8. **Iterate and Improve**: Use the feedback to iterate and improve the solution.

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam

# Create a team
team = AgentTeam("Niche AI Tools")

# Run niche analysis
niches = team.run_niche_analysis(["e-commerce", "content creation"])

# Select a niche
selected_niche = niches[0]

# Develop a solution
solution = team.develop_solution(selected_niche["id"])

# Create a monetization strategy
monetization_strategy = team.create_monetization_strategy(solution["id"])

# Create a marketing campaign
marketing_campaign = team.create_marketing_campaign(solution["id"], monetization_strategy["id"])

# Collect and analyze feedback
feedback_analysis = team.collect_and_analyze_feedback(solution["id"])

# Iterate and improve
improved_solution = team.iterate_and_improve(solution["id"], feedback_analysis["id"])
```

---

## Integration with AI Models

The Agent Team can be integrated with local AI models using the `AgentModelProvider` class from the `ai_models` module. This allows the agents to use local AI models for their tasks instead of relying on external API calls.

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam
from ai_models import ModelManager, AgentModelProvider

# Create a model manager
manager = ModelManager()

# Create an agent model provider
provider = AgentModelProvider(manager)

# Create a team with the agent model provider
team = AgentTeam("My Team", agent_model_provider=provider)

# Now the team will use local AI models for its tasks
```

## Example: Complete Workflow

Here's a complete example that demonstrates the entire workflow of the Agent Team:

---

## CrewAI Integration

This section describes the CrewAI integration in `agent_team/crewai_agents.py`. This integration provides a different approach to agent teams, using the CrewAI framework for multi-agent orchestration.

### Usage

The `agent_team/crewai_agents.py` file defines example agent roles (Data Gatherer, Analyzer, Writer) and a simple workflow using the CrewAI framework.

To run the included workflow:

```bash
python agent_team/crewai_agents.py
```

This will execute the example agents and tasks, demonstrating a basic CrewAI workflow.

### Extending the CrewAI Integration

To extend the CrewAI integration, you can:

- Define new agent roles with specific goals and backstories.
- Create tasks that agents can perform.
- Assemble agents and tasks into crews to create complex workflows.

Refer to the CrewAI documentation for more information on how to use and extend the framework:

- [CrewAI Documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/)
- [CrewAI GitHub](https://github.com/VisionBlack/CrewAI)

---

### Testing

A minimal test scaffold is provided in `tests/test_crewai_agents.py` to verify the CrewAI integration.

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam

# Create a team
team = AgentTeam("Niche AI Tools")

# Define market segments to analyze
market_segments = [
    "e-commerce",
    "content creation",
    "freelancing",
    "education",
    "real estate",
]

# Run niche analysis
niches = team.run_niche_analysis(market_segments)

# Print identified niches
for i, niche in enumerate(niches):
    print(f"{i+1}. {niche['name']} (Score: {niche['opportunity_score']:.2f})")

# Select the highest-scoring niche
selected_niche = max(niches, key=lambda x: x["opportunity_score"])
print(f"Selected niche: {selected_niche['name']}")

# Develop a solution
solution = team.develop_solution(selected_niche["id"])
print(f"Developed solution: {solution['name']}")

# Create a monetization strategy
monetization_strategy = team.create_monetization_strategy(solution["id"])
print(f"Created monetization strategy: {monetization_strategy['name']}")

# Create a marketing campaign
marketing_campaign = team.create_marketing_campaign(solution["id"], monetization_strategy["id"])
print(f"Created marketing campaign: {marketing_campaign['name']}")

# Collect and analyze feedback
feedback_analysis = team.collect_and_analyze_feedback(solution["id"])
print(f"Collected and analyzed feedback: {len(feedback_analysis['feedback_items'])} items")

# Iterate and improve
improved_solution = team.iterate_and_improve(solution["id"], feedback_analysis["id"])
print(f"Improved solution: {improved_solution['name']}")
```
