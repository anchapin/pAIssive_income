# Niche Analysis Algorithms

This document provides detailed documentation of the algorithms implemented in the niche analysis module of the pAIssive Income framework. It explains the computational approaches, data models, and decision-making logic used in each of the key algorithms.

## Market Analysis Algorithms

The `MarketAnalyzer` class implements several algorithms for analyzing market segments and identifying potential niches.

### Market Segment Analysis Algorithm

The market segment analysis algorithm analyzes a market segment to identify potential niches.

#### Algorithm Overview

```
Input: Market segment name
Output: Market segment analysis

1. Validate input (must be a non-empty string)
2. Match segment name (case-insensitive) against known market segments
3. If match found:
   a. Return pre-defined analysis for that segment
4. If no match found:
   a. Generate default analysis for unknown segment
5. Return analysis
```

#### Implementation Details

The current implementation uses a knowledge-based approach with pre-defined information about common market segments. In a production environment, this would use AI models to dynamically analyze market segments based on current data.

The algorithm provides the following information for each segment:
- Market size (large, medium, small, unknown)
- Growth rate (high, medium, low, unknown)
- Competition (high, medium, low, unknown)

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(1) - Dictionary lookup based on segment name

### Target User Analysis Algorithm

The target user analysis algorithm identifies and profiles target users for a specific niche.

#### Algorithm Overview

```

6. Define buying behavior patterns
7. Return comprehensive target user analysis
```

#### Implementation Details

The algorithm creates a detailed profile of target users, including:
- User segments (list of user segment profiles)
- Demographics (age, gender, location, education, income)
- Psychographics (goals, values, challenges)
- Pain points (list of common pain points)
- Goals (list of common goals)
- Buying behavior (decision factors, purchase process, price sensitivity)

Each user segment profile includes:
- Name and description
- Segment size (large, medium, small)
- Priority level (high, medium, low)

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(s) - Where s is the number of user segments

## Problem Identification Algorithms

The `ProblemIdentifier` class implements algorithms for identifying and analyzing problems in specific niches.

### Problem Identification Algorithm

The problem identification algorithm identifies problems and pain points in specific niches.

#### Algorithm Overview

```
Input: Niche name
Output: List of problems

1. Validate input (must be a non-empty string)
2. Match niche name (case-insensitive) against known niches
3. If match found:
   a. Return pre-defined problems for that niche
4. If no match found:
   a. Check if niche contains certain keywords (e.g., e-commerce, content, freelancing)
   b. Return domain-specific generic problems if keywords match
   c. Return general generic problems if no keywords match
5. Return list of problems
```

#### Implementation Details

The algorithm uses a knowledge-based approach with pre-defined problems for common niches. For unknown niches, it attempts to categorize them based on keywords and provides domain-specific or general problems.

Each problem includes:
- Unique ID
- Name and description
- List of consequences
- Severity level (high, medium, low)
- Current solution information
- Solution gap information
- Timestamp

In a production implementation, this algorithm would use AI models to dynamically identify problems in any niche based on current data and user research.

#### Matching Logic

The algorithm uses exact matching for known niches:
```python
niche_problems = {
    "inventory management for small e-commerce": [...],
    "youtube script generation": [...],
    "freelance proposal writing": [...],
    # ... more pre-defined niches
}

problems = niche_problems.get(niche.lower(), [])
```

For unknown niches, it uses keyword matching:
```python
if "e-commerce" in niche or "ecommerce" in niche:
    return [...e-commerce related problems...]
elif "content" in niche or "writing" in niche:
    return [...content related problems...]
elif "freelance" in niche or "freelancing" in niche:
    return [...freelancing related problems...]
else:
    return [...generic problems...]
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(1) for known niches (dictionary lookup), O(k) for unknown niches (keyword checking)
- Space complexity: O(n × p) - Where n is the number of pre-defined niches and p is the average number of problems per niche

### Problem Severity Analysis Algorithm

The problem severity analysis algorithm evaluates the severity of specific problems.

#### Algorithm Overview

```
Input: Problem dictionary

1. Validate input (must be a non-empty dictionary with required fields)
2. Extract severity level from problem (high, medium, low)
3. Map severity level to detailed analysis:
   a. Impact on users
   b. Frequency
   c. Emotional response
   d. Business impact
   e. Urgency
4. Determine potential impact of solution based on severity
5. Determine user willingness to pay based on severity
6. Return comprehensive severity analysis
```

#### Implementation Details

The algorithm maps severity levels to detailed analysis attributes:

| Severity | Impact on Users | Frequency | Emotional Response | Business Impact | Urgency |
|----------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| High | Significant negative impact | Frequently experienced | High frustration | Significant revenue loss | Immediate solution needed |
| Medium | Moderate negative impact | Occasionally experienced | Moderate frustration | Moderate revenue loss | Solution needed in near term |
| Low | Minor negative impact | Rarely experienced | Minor annoyance | Minimal revenue loss | Solution beneficial but not urgent |

The algorithm also maps severity levels to solution impact and willingness to pay:
- High severity → High impact & High willingness to pay
- Medium severity → Medium impact & Medium willingness to pay
- Low severity → Low impact & Low willingness to pay

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(1) - Simple mapping based on severity level
- Space complexity: O(1) - Fixed-size data structures
