# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status

The project currently has a test coverage below the required 80% threshold. We have set the coverage threshold to 80% in `pytest.ini` to enforce this requirement. This document outlines the plan to improve test coverage to meet this threshold.

## Goals

1. Achieve at least 80% test coverage across the codebase
2. Maintain the `--cov-fail-under=80` parameter in `pytest.ini`
3. Ensure all critical functionality has comprehensive test coverage

## Approach

### Phase 1: Assessment (Current)

- Identify modules with low test coverage
- Prioritize modules based on importance and complexity
- Create a list of modules that need additional tests

### Phase 2: Implementation

- Add tests for high-priority modules first
- Focus on critical functionality and edge cases
- Ensure tests are meaningful and not just for coverage

### Phase 3: Verification

- Run tests with coverage reports to track progress
- Maintain the 80% coverage threshold in `pytest.ini`
- Ensure all tests pass with the required coverage threshold

## Prioritized Modules

The following modules have been identified as needing additional test coverage:

1. `ai_models/adapters/mcp_adapter.py`
2. `ai_models/adapters/adapter_factory.py`
3. `ai_models/adapters/openai_compatible_adapter.py`
4. `ai_models/adapters/ollama_adapter.py`
5. `ai_models/adapters/lmstudio_adapter.py`
6. `common_utils/logging/log_utils.py`
7. `common_utils/logging/examples.py`
8. `common_utils/secrets/config.py`
9. `api/utils/auth.py`
10. `api/test_flask_app.py`

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Add tests for `ai_models/adapters` modules
- **Week 2**: Add tests for `common_utils` modules
- **Week 3**: Add tests for `api` modules
- **Week 4**: Review coverage and restore threshold

## Tracking Progress

Progress will be tracked by running the following command:

```bash
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```

The coverage report will be reviewed weekly to ensure progress is being made.

## Conclusion

By following this plan, we will improve the test coverage of the codebase and ensure that the 80% threshold is met. This will improve the quality and reliability of the code and make it easier to maintain in the future.
