# Security Overview

This document summarizes the security posture, policies, and best practices for the project.

## Security Policy & Reporting

See [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) for the official security policy and reporting procedures.

## Overview

Security is a first-class concern across all areas of the codebase. Key areas include:
- Safe handling of secrets and credentials
- Secure logging (no sensitive data in logs)
- Secure serialization and deserialization
- Input validation everywhere (network, user, API)
- Secure configuration and defaults
- Regular dependency and code scanning

### Current Security Status ✅
- **CodeQL Configuration**: Fully validated and operational
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: All identified issues resolved (PR #243)
- **Sensitive Data Logging**: Eliminated from all code paths
- **Configuration Standards**: Established and documented

## Best Practices

- No use of `pickle` or unsafe serialization
- All network operations must have explicit timeouts
- Input validation is required for all external data
- No `shell=True` in subprocess calls
- Secure logger (see implementation in common_utils/logging)
- Mask secrets in logs and outputs
- Secure defaults in configs
- Security review required for all PRs
