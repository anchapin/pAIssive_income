# ARTIST Framework Implementation Recommendations

## Overview

This document provides specific recommendations for implementing the ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-improving Transformers) framework within our codebase. These recommendations focus on practical steps to enhance our existing agent system with ARTIST principles.

## Core Architecture Recommendations

### 1. Enhanced ArtistAgent Class

The current `ArtistAgent` class should be extended to incorporate ARTIST's key components:

```python
class EnhancedArtistAgent:
    """Agent that implements ARTIST framework principles."""

    def __init__(self, model_provider=None, learning_rate=0.01):
        """Initialize the agent with available tools and learning parameters."""
        self.tools = tooling.list_tools()
        self.model_provider = model_provider  # LLM provider
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.reasoning_history = []  # Store reasoning paths for learning
        
    def reason(self, prompt: str) -> dict:
        """
        Generate reasoning steps, potentially including tool queries.
        
        Returns:
            dict: Contains reasoning steps, tool queries, and final answer
        """
        # Implementation would use the model_provider to generate reasoning
        pass
        
    def decide_tool_use(self, reasoning_step: str) -> tuple:
        """
        Decide whether to use a tool and which one.
        
        Returns:
            tuple: (use_tool, tool_name, tool_query)
        """
        pass
        
    def execute_tool(self, tool_name: str, tool_query: str) -> str:
        """Execute a tool and return its output."""
        if tool_name in self.tools:
            tool_func = self.tools[tool_name]
            return str(tool_func(tool_query))
        return f"Error: Tool '{tool_name}' not found"
        
    def update_policy(self, prompt: str, reasoning_path: dict, reward: float):
        """Update the agent's policy based on reward signal."""
        # Implementation would depend on the RL approach used
        pass
        
    def run(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        """
        Process a prompt using ARTIST methodology.
        
        Args:
            prompt (str): The user's input/problem.
            
        Returns:
            str: The final answer after reasoning and tool use.
        """
        reasoning_path = self.reason(prompt)
        
        # Process reasoning steps, potentially using tools
        for step in reasoning_path["steps"]:
            use_tool, tool_name, tool_query = self.decide_tool_use(step["content"])
            
            if use_tool:
                tool_output = self.execute_tool(tool_name, tool_query)
                # Add tool output to reasoning path
                step["tool_use"] = {
                    "tool": tool_name,
                    "query": tool_query,
                    "output": tool_output
                }
        
        # Store reasoning path for learning
        self.reasoning_history.append({
            "prompt": prompt,
            "reasoning_path": reasoning_path
        })
        
        return reasoning_path["answer"]
```

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Module

Implement a new module for the reinforcement learning component of ARTIST:

```python
class ArtistRLTrainer:
    """Implements ARTIST's reinforcement learning approach."""
    
    def __init__(self, agent, reward_function, learning_rate=0.01):
        """
        Initialize the RL trainer.
        
        Args:
            agent: The EnhancedArtistAgent to train
            reward_function: Function that evaluates reasoning paths
            learning_rate: Learning rate for policy updates
        """
        self.agent = agent
        self.reward_function = reward_function
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        
    def train_on_dataset(self, dataset, epochs=1):
        """
        Train the agent on a dataset of problems.
        
        Args:
            dataset: List of problem prompts with ground truth answers
            epochs: Number of training epochs
        """
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            total_reward = 0
            
            for item in dataset:
                prompt = item["prompt"]
                ground_truth = item["answer"]
                
                # Generate reasoning path
                reasoning_path = self.agent.reason(prompt)
                
                # Calculate reward
                reward = self.reward_function(reasoning_path, ground_truth)
                total_reward += reward
                
                # Update policy
                self.agent.update_policy(prompt, reasoning_path, reward)
                
            avg_reward = total_reward / len(dataset)
            print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Average Reward: {avg_reward}")
            
    def evaluate(self, test_dataset):
        """
        Evaluate the agent on a test dataset.
        
        Args:
            test_dataset: List of problem prompts with ground truth answers
            
        Returns:
            dict: Evaluation metrics
        """
        correct = 0
        total_reward = 0
        
        for item in test_dataset:
            prompt = item["prompt"]
            ground_truth = item["answer"]
            
            # Generate reasoning path
            reasoning_path = self.agent.reason(prompt)
            
            # Calculate reward
            reward = self.reward_function(reasoning_path, ground_truth)
            total_reward += reward
            
            # Check correctness
            if reasoning_path["answer"] == ground_truth:
                correct += 1
                
        return {
            "accuracy": correct / len(test_dataset),
            "average_reward": total_reward / len(test_dataset)
        }
```

### 3. Reward Functions

Implement composite reward functions as described in the ARTIST paper:

```python
def mathematical_problem_reward(reasoning_path, ground_truth):
    """
    Calculate reward for mathematical problem solving.
    
    Args:
        reasoning_path: The agent's reasoning path
        ground_truth: The correct answer
        
    Returns:
        float: Reward value
    """
    # Base reward for correct answer
    correctness_reward = 1.0 if reasoning_path["answer"] == ground_truth else 0.0
    
    # Reward for proper tool use
    tool_use_reward = 0.0
    tool_use_count = 0
    
    for step in reasoning_path["steps"]:
        if "tool_use" in step:
            tool_use_count += 1
            # Check if tool was used appropriately
            if is_tool_use_appropriate(step["content"], step["tool_use"]):
                tool_use_reward += 0.2
    
    # Penalize excessive tool use
    if tool_use_count > 5:
        tool_use_reward -= 0.1 * (tool_use_count - 5)
    
    # Reward for reasoning quality
    reasoning_reward = assess_reasoning_quality(reasoning_path["steps"])
    
    # Combine rewards
    total_reward = (
        0.6 * correctness_reward +
        0.2 * tool_use_reward +
        0.2 * reasoning_reward
    )
    
    return total_reward
```

## Integration with Existing Codebase

### 1. Tool Registry Enhancements

Enhance the existing tool registry in `common_utils/tooling.py`:

```python
def register_tool_with_metadata(name: str, func: Callable[..., Any], metadata: dict) -> None:
    """
    Register a callable tool with metadata.
    
    Args:
        name (str): Name of the tool.
        func (Callable): Function implementing the tool.
        metadata (dict): Tool metadata including:
            - description: Tool description
            - input_schema: Expected input format
            - output_schema: Expected output format
            - examples: Usage examples
    """
    _TOOL_REGISTRY[name] = {
        "func": func,
        "metadata": metadata
    }

def get_tool_metadata(name: str) -> dict:
    """
    Get metadata for a registered tool.
    
    Args:
        name (str): Name of the tool.
        
    Returns:
        dict: Tool metadata
    """
    if name in _TOOL_REGISTRY and isinstance(_TOOL_REGISTRY[name], dict):
        return _TOOL_REGISTRY[name].get("metadata", {})
    return {}
```

### 2. Mathematical Tools

Implement enhanced mathematical tools for the pilot use case:

```python
from sympy import symbols, solve, sympify, SympifyError

def equation_solver(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Solve algebraic equations.
    
    Args:
        query (str): Equation to solve, e.g., "x^2 - 5*x + 6 = 0"
        
    Returns:
        str: Solution to the equation
    """
    try:
        # Parse the equation
        if "=" in query:
            left, right = query.split("=")
            equation = f"({left}) - ({right})"
        else:
            equation = query
            
        # Define symbol and solve
        x = symbols('x')
        expr = sympify(equation)
        solutions = solve(expr, x)
        
        if not solutions:
            return "No solutions found"
        
        return f"Solutions: {', '.join(str(sol) for sol in solutions)}"
    except SympifyError:
        return "Error: Could not parse the equation"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

# Register the tool with metadata
register_tool_with_metadata(
    "equation_solver",
    equation_solver,
    {
        "description": "Solves algebraic equations",
        "input_schema": "String representing an equation (e.g., 'x^2 - 5*x + 6 = 0')",
        "output_schema": "String with solutions or error message",
        "examples": [
            {"input": "x^2 - 5*x + 6 = 0", "output": "Solutions: 2, 3"},
            {"input": "x^3 - x = 0", "output": "Solutions: -1, 0, 1"}
        ]
    }
)
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)

1. Implement the enhanced `ArtistAgent` class
2. Extend the tool registry with metadata support
3. Implement basic mathematical tools
4. Create a simple evaluation framework

### Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning (3-4 weeks)

1. Implement the `ArtistRLTrainer` class
2. Create reward functions for mathematical problem-solving
3. Develop a training dataset of mathematical problems
4. Implement policy update mechanisms

### Phase 3: Integration and Evaluation (2-3 weeks)

1. Integrate the ARTIST implementation with the existing agent system
2. Conduct comparative evaluations against baseline
3. Document performance improvements
4. Create a demo showcasing the enhanced capabilities

## Dependencies and Requirements

To implement ARTIST, we'll need the following additional dependencies:

```
# For mathematical tools
sympy>=1.11.0

# For reinforcement learning
torch>=1.10.0
transformers>=4.20.0

# For evaluation
matplotlib>=3.5.0
pandas>=1.3.0
```

## Conclusion

Implementing the ARTIST framework will significantly enhance our agent system's capabilities, particularly in complex reasoning and tool use. The recommended approach builds on our existing codebase while introducing the key innovations from ARTIST. Starting with the mathematical problem-solving pilot will provide a clear demonstration of value while establishing a foundation for broader implementation across other use cases.
