# Docker Compose CI Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the Docker Compose CI workflow to address performance and reliability issues.

## Overview

The Docker Compose CI workflow was experiencing issues with long execution times due to inefficient health checking. The main problem was that the `wait_for_services` function in `scripts/run-docker-compose-ci.sh` was always running for the maximum number of attempts (45 loops with 10-second sleeps) even if the services became healthy earlier.

## Changes Made

### 1. Early Break Condition

Added an early break condition in the `wait_for_services` function to exit the loop as soon as services are detected as healthy:

```bash
# Set flag to indicate services are healthy
services_healthy=true
# Break out of the loop early since services are healthy
break
```

### 2. Proper Return Code Handling

Fixed the return code handling in the `wait_for_services` function to properly indicate success/failure:

```bash
# Check if services became healthy
if [ "$services_healthy" = true ]; then
  log "✅ Services are healthy and ready"
  return 0
else
  # Return failure to indicate services are not healthy
  log "Continuing despite health check issues..."
  return 1
fi
```

### 3. Improved Main Function Logic

Updated the main function to correctly handle the return value from `wait_for_services`:

```bash
# Wait for services to be healthy
local health_check_result=0
wait_for_services "$compose_cmd" || health_check_result=$?

# If services are not healthy (return code is non-zero)
if [ $health_check_result -ne 0 ]; then
  log "⚠️ Services did not become fully healthy, but continuing..."
  # ... recovery logic ...
else
  log "✅ Services became healthy within the timeout period"
fi
```

## Benefits

These changes provide several benefits:

1. **Reduced CI Time**: The workflow now completes faster when services become healthy quickly, as it no longer waits for the full 45 attempts.

2. **Better Error Handling**: The script now properly indicates whether services became healthy, allowing for more accurate error handling.

3. **Improved Logging**: Added more descriptive log messages to better understand the state of services.

## Related Files

The following files were modified as part of this improvement:

- `scripts/run-docker-compose-ci.sh`: Main script with the health check logic
- `.github/workflows/codeql-macos.yml`: Added `continue-on-error: true` for lock file detection
- `.github/workflows/codeql-ubuntu.yml`: Fixed heredoc syntax
- `.github/workflows/consolidated-ci-cd.yml`: Fixed PowerShell heredoc syntax

## Testing

The changes were tested by:

1. Running the Docker Compose CI workflow locally
2. Verifying that the workflow exits early when services become healthy
3. Confirming proper error handling when services fail to become healthy

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. Implementing more sophisticated health check logic
2. Adding timeout configuration options
3. Improving error recovery mechanisms
