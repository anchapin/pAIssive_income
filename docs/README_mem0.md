# mem0 Investigation

This directory contains the results of our investigation into mem0, a memory layer for AI agents and assistants.

## Overview

[mem0](https://mem0.ai) is a memory system that enables AI agents to remember user preferences, past interactions, and important information across conversations. This investigation explores its features, integration options, and potential use in our project.

## Key Findings

1. **Memory Capabilities**: mem0 provides a robust system for storing and retrieving memories in AI agents
2. **Integration Options**: Multiple approaches available, from direct dependency to managed API
3. **Dependencies**: Compatible with our existing stack, with minimal conflicts
4. **Performance**: Efficient memory retrieval with semantic search capabilities
5. **Customization**: Configurable to our specific needs

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype Integration**: Create a simple prototype to test mem0 integration
2. **Evaluate Performance**: Assess memory retrieval quality and performance
3. **Security Review**: Evaluate data security implications
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Check for conflicts with existing dependencies
5. **Decision on Integration Approach**: Choose between managed platform and self-hosted

## Getting Started

To explore mem0 locally:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key (required by mem0):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

3. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   python examples/test_mem0_local.py
   ```

4. Explore the example integration:
   ```bash
   python examples/mem0_integration_example.py
   ```

## Conclusion

mem0 offers a promising solution for adding persistent memory capabilities to our AI agents. The open-source option provides flexibility and control, while the managed platform offers convenience and reduced maintenance overhead. Further testing is recommended to evaluate its effectiveness in our specific use cases.
