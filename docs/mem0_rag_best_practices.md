# Best Practices for Using mem0 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Together

This guide outlines best practices for AI agent developers and users on when and how to use mem0 (persistent memory) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), both separately and in combination. It includes practical recommendations, decision guidelines, and code examples.

---

## Overview

- **mem0** provides long-term, user-specific, persistent memory for agents (facts, preferences, prior interactions).
- **RAG** augments LLM responses by retrieving relevant external documents or knowledge at query time (dynamic context, up-to-date information).

**Combined use unlocks powerful, context-aware, and adaptive AI agents.**

---

## When to Use mem0

- To remember user preferences, history, or feedback across sessions.
- For agent personalization: e.g., "remind me to check the news every Monday."
- For storing structured facts, user actions, or conversation history.
- When information is user-specific and must persist.

**Example:**
```python
memory.add("User prefers vegetarian recipes", user_id="alice")
```

---

## When to Use RAG

- To ground answers in up-to-date, external, or domain-specific documents.
- When answering questions that reference current events, technical docs, or large knowledge bases.
- For dynamic, "open book" information needs (e.g., "What's new in Python 3.12?").

**Example:**
```python
results = rag_retrieve("What are the latest features in Python?", top_k=3)
```

## When and How to Combine mem0 and RAG

- For highly adaptive, user-centric agents that need both long-term memory and dynamic knowledge.
- To contextualize retrieval: use mem0 to personalize or filter RAG results.
- To store and recall user feedback on retrieved/generated content.

**Combined Workflow Example:**
```python
# 1. Retrieve user memory (mem0)
user_prefs = memory.search("What are Alice's dietary restrictions?", user_id="alice")

# 2. Retrieve external knowledge (RAG)
recipes = rag_retrieve("vegetarian dinner recipes", top_k=5)

# 3. Combine: filter or rank recipes based on user memory
personalized_recipes = filter_recipes_by_preferences(recipes, user_prefs)
```

## Patterns for Isolated and Synergistic Use

### A. Isolated Use Cases

- **mem0 only:** Personal reminders, user onboarding, preference tracking.
- **RAG only:** Factual Q&A, document summarization, technical support.

### B. Synergistic (Combined) Use Cases

- **Personalized Search:** Use mem0 to bias or re-rank RAG results.
- **Feedback Loop:** Store user feedback on RAG outputs in mem0 for future adaptation.
- **Contextual Prompts:** Prefill agent prompts with both relevant memories and retrieved docs.

**Synergistic Example:**
```python
# After generating a RAG response, store user feedback in mem0
memory.add(f"User rated recipe '{recipe_title}' as 'liked'", user_id="alice")
```

## Best Practice Recommendations

- **Default to mem0** for persistent, user-specific context.
- **Default to RAG** for up-to-date, external, or domain-specific knowledge.
- **Combine** when you want personalized, dynamic responses: retrieve memory first, then use it to inform or personalize the RAG system's document retrieval.
- **Store feedback** and user-generated knowledge in mem0 for cumulative improvement.
- **Log and monitor** combined workflows to identify when memory or retrieval is most impactful.

## Example: Agent Workflow

```python
# Pseudocode for a combined agent
def agent_respond(query, user_id):
    mem_context = memory.search(query, user_id=user_id)
    rag_context = rag_retrieve(query, top_k=3)
    final_prompt = (
        f"User memory: {mem_context}\n"
        f"Relevant docs: {rag_context}\n"
        f"User query: {query}\n"
        "Respond helpfully."
    )
    response = llm(final_prompt)
    return response
```
