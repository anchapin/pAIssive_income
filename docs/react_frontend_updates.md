## Implementation Details

### Accessibility Implementation

The accessibility improvements follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards and include:

```jsx
// Example of ARIA attributes in navigation
<Drawer
  variant="persistent"
  anchor="left"
  open={open}
  role="navigation"
  aria-label="Main Navigation"
>
  {/* Navigation content */}
</Drawer>

// Example of accessible button with loading state
<Button
  type="submit"
  fullWidth
  variant="contained"
  color="primary"
  disabled={!isValid || isSubmitting}
  aria-label="Log In"
  startIcon={!isSubmitting && <span role="img" aria-label="login">ðŸ”‘</span>}
>
  {isSubmitting ? <CircularProgress size={24} /> : "Log In"}
</Button>
```

### Security Implementation

Security enhancements focus on protecting sensitive data:

```jsx
// Example of secure credential handling
const submitLogin = async (formData) => {
  try {
    // Call login function from context
    await login({
      username: formData.username,
      credential: formData.credentials // Use credential instead of password
    });

    // Immediately clear sensitive data from memory
    formData.credentials = '';
    
    // Call onSuccess callback if provided
    if (onSuccess) {
      onSuccess();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Generic error message to prevent enumeration attacks
    setServerError(
      'Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and try again.'
    );
    
    // Log only non-sensitive information
    console.error('Login error occurred', {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      hasUsername: Boolean(formData.username)
    });
  }
};
```

## Testing

The updated components have been tested for:

- **Accessibility**: Using automated tools and manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Responsiveness**: Across different viewport sizes and devices
- **Security**: Following best practices for handling sensitive data
- **Browser Compatibility**: Across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Future Improvements

Planned future improvements include:

1. Implementing end-to-end testing for critical user flows
2. Adding internationalization (i18n) support
3. Enhancing data visualization components with more interactive features
4. Implementing theme customization options
5. Adding more advanced accessibility features like focus trapping in modals
