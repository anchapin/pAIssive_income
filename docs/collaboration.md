# Collaboration Module

The Collaboration module provides functionality for team collaboration, project sharing, and other collaborative features to enable teams to work together effectively on AI solutions.

## Overview

The Collaboration module includes the following components:

1. **TeamWorkspace**: Represents a shared workspace for a team, containing projects, resources, and settings.
2. **WorkspaceManager**: Manages multiple team workspaces.
3. **RoleManager**: Manages roles and permissions for access control.
4. **ProjectSharing**: Manages project sharing between users and workspaces.
5. **VersionControl**: Manages version control for projects and resources.
6. **ActivityTracker**: Tracks user activity in workspaces and projects.
7. **NotificationManager**: Manages notifications for users.
8. **CommentSystem**: Manages comments and reactions on projects and resources.
9. **CollaborationIntegration**: Manages integrations with external collaboration tools.
10. **ExportImport**: Manages export and import of projects and workspaces.

## Getting Started

### Creating a Team Workspace

```python
from collaboration import WorkspaceManager, TeamWorkspace

# Create a workspace manager
workspace_manager = WorkspaceManager()

# Create a new workspace
workspace = workspace_manager.create_workspace(
    name="My Team Workspace",
    description="A workspace for my team",
    owner_id="user123"
)

# Add members to the workspace
workspace.add_member(user_id="user456", role="editor", added_by="user123")
workspace.add_member(user_id="user789", role="viewer", added_by="user123")

# Add a project to the workspace
project = workspace.add_project(
    project_id="project123",
    project_name="My Project",
    description="A collaborative project",
    created_by="user123"
)
```

### Managing Roles and Permissions

```python
from collaboration import RoleManager, Role, Permission

# Create a role manager
role_manager = RoleManager()

# Create a custom role
custom_role = Role("project_manager", "Can manage projects but not workspace settings")
custom_role.add_permission(Permission.VIEW_WORKSPACE)
custom_role.add_permission(Permission.CREATE_PROJECT)
custom_role.add_permission(Permission.VIEW_ALL_PROJECTS)
custom_role.add_permission(Permission.EDIT_ALL_PROJECTS)
custom_role.add_permission(Permission.DELETE_PROJECT)

# Add the role to the manager
role_manager.add_role(custom_role)

# Check if a role has a permission
has_permission = custom_role.has_permission(Permission.EDIT_WORKSPACE)  # False
```

### Sharing Projects

```python
from collaboration import ProjectSharing, SharingPermission

# Create a project sharing manager
sharing = ProjectSharing()

# Share a project with a user
share_info = sharing.share_project_with_user(
    project_id="project123",
    user_id="user456",
    permission=SharingPermission.EDIT,
    shared_by="user123",
    workspace_id="workspace123"
)

# Create a sharing link
link_info = sharing.create_sharing_link(
    project_id="project123",
    permission=SharingPermission.VIEW,
    created_by="user123",
    workspace_id="workspace123",
    expiry=86400,  # 24 hours
    max_uses=10
)

# Get projects shared with a user
shared_projects = sharing.get_user_shared_projects("user456")
```

### Version Control

```python
from collaboration import VersionControl, VersionInfo

# Create a version control manager
version_control = VersionControl()

# Create a new version
version_info = version_control.create_version(
    project_id="project123",
    project_path="/path/to/project",
    created_by="user123",
    description="Initial version",
    tags=["v1.0", "initial"]
)

# Get project versions
versions = version_control.get_project_versions("project123")

# Restore a version
version_control.restore_version(
    version_id=version_info.version_id,
    target_path="/path/to/restore",
    restore_by="user123"
)

# Compare versions
diff = version_control.compare_versions(
    version_id1="version1",
    version_id2="version2"
)
```

### Activity Tracking

```python
from collaboration import ActivityTracker, ActivityType, ActivityLog

# Create an activity tracker
activity_tracker = ActivityTracker()

# Log an activity
activity = activity_tracker.log_activity(
    activity_type=ActivityType.PROJECT_UPDATED,
    user_id="user123",
    workspace_id="workspace123",
    project_id="project123",
    description="Updated project settings",
    metadata={"setting": "privacy", "value": "private"}
)

# Get workspace activities
activities = activity_tracker.get_workspace_activities("workspace123", limit=10)

# Get user activities
user_activities = activity_tracker.get_user_activities("user123", limit=10)
```

### Notifications

```python
from collaboration import NotificationManager

# Create a notification manager
notification_manager = NotificationManager()

# Create a notification
notification = notification_manager.create_notification(
    user_id="user456",
    title="Project Updated",
    message="The project 'My Project' has been updated",
    project_id="project123",
    workspace_id="workspace123"
)

# Get user notifications
notifications = notification_manager.get_user_notifications("user456", unread_only=True)

# Mark a notification as read
notification_manager.mark_as_read(notification["notification_id"])
```

### Comments and Reactions

```python
from collaboration import CommentSystem, ReactionType

# Create a comment system
comment_system = CommentSystem()

# Add a comment
comment = comment_system.add_comment(
    content="This looks great!",
    user_id="user456",
    resource_type="project",
    resource_id="project123"
)

# Add a reply
reply = comment_system.add_comment(
    content="Thanks for the feedback!",
    user_id="user123",
    resource_type="project",
    resource_id="project123",
    parent_id=comment.comment_id
)

# Add a reaction
reaction = comment_system.add_reaction(
    comment_id=comment.comment_id,
    reaction_type=ReactionType.LIKE,
    user_id="user789"
)

# Get comments for a resource
comments = comment_system.get_resource_comments("project", "project123")
```

### External Integrations

```python
from collaboration import CollaborationIntegration, IntegrationType

# Create an integration manager
integration_manager = CollaborationIntegration()

# Add a GitHub integration
github_integration = integration_manager.add_integration(
    workspace_id="workspace123",
    integration_type=IntegrationType.GITHUB,
    name="My GitHub Integration",
    config={
        "token": "your_github_token_here",
        "repository": "username/repo"
    },
    created_by="user123"
)

# Sync with GitHub
sync_result = integration_manager.sync_integration(github_integration["integration_id"])

# Send a notification through Slack
slack_integration = integration_manager.add_integration(
    workspace_id="workspace123",
    integration_type=IntegrationType.SLACK,
    name="My Slack Integration",
    config={
        "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
    },
    created_by="user123"
)

notification_result = integration_manager.send_notification(
    integration_id=slack_integration["integration_id"],
    message="New version created for project 'My Project'",
    channel="#project-updates"
)
```

### Export and Import

```python
from collaboration import ExportImport

# Create an export/import manager
export_import = ExportImport()

# Export a project
export_file = export_import.export_project(
    project_id="project123",
    project_path="/path/to/project",
    project_data=project,
    include_history=True,
    include_comments=True
)

# Import a project
import_result = export_import.import_project(
    import_file=export_file,
    target_path="/path/to/import",
    new_project_id="new_project_id"
)

# Export a workspace
workspace_export = export_import.export_workspace(
    workspace_id="workspace123",
    workspace_path="/path/to/workspace",
    workspace_data=workspace.to_dict(),
    include_projects=True
)

# List available exports
exports = export_import.list_exports()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Use roles and permissions to control access to workspaces and projects. Assign the minimum necessary permissions to each role.

2. **Version Control**: Create versions at significant milestones or before making major changes. Use tags to mark important versions.

3. **Activity Tracking**: Monitor activity to understand how your team is using the system and to identify potential issues.

4. **Notifications**: Use notifications to keep team members informed about important events and changes.

5. **Comments and Feedback**: Encourage team members to provide feedback through comments and reactions.

6. **External Integrations**: Integrate with the tools your team already uses to streamline workflows.

7. **Regular Backups**: Export projects and workspaces regularly to create backups.

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Ensure that all users are properly authenticated before accessing workspaces and projects.

2. **Authorization**: Use the role-based access control system to enforce proper authorization.

3. **Sensitive Data**: Be careful when sharing projects that contain sensitive data. Use the appropriate sharing permissions.

4. **External Integrations**: Store API tokens and other credentials securely. Review the permissions granted to external integrations.

5. **Audit Logging**: Use activity tracking to maintain an audit log of all actions.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Permission Errors**: If a user cannot access a resource, check their role and the permissions assigned to that role.

2. **Sharing Issues**: If a user cannot access a shared project, verify that the sharing has not expired or been revoked.

3. **Version Control Problems**: If version creation or restoration fails, check that the project path exists and is accessible.

4. **Integration Errors**: If an external integration fails, check the configuration and ensure that the API tokens are valid.

5. **Export/Import Issues**: If export or import fails, check that the file paths are correct and that the user has the necessary permissions.
