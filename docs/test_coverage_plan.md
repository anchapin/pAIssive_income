# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status

The project currently has a test coverage below the required 80% threshold. We have maintained the 80% coverage threshold in both:
- `pytest.ini`
- `.github/workflows/consolidated-ci-cd.yml`

This document outlines the plan to improve test coverage to meet the 80% threshold.

## Goals

1. Achieve at least 80% test coverage across the codebase
2. Maintain the `--cov-fail-under=80` parameter in both configuration files
3. Ensure all critical functionality has comprehensive test coverage

## Approach

### Phase 1: Assessment (Current)

- Identify modules with low test coverage
- Prioritize modules based on importance and complexity
- Create a list of modules that need additional tests

### Phase 2: Implementation

- Add tests for high-priority modules first
- Focus on critical functionality and edge cases
- Ensure tests are meaningful and not just for coverage

### Phase 3: Verification

- Run tests with coverage reports to track progress
- Maintain the 80% coverage threshold in `pytest.ini` and GitHub Actions workflow
- Ensure all tests pass with the required coverage threshold

## Prioritized Modules

The following modules have been identified as needing additional test coverage:

1. **Core Functionality**
   - `ai_models/adapters/adapter_factory.py`
   - `ai_models/artist_agent.py`
   - `common_utils/config_loader.py`
   - `common_utils/exceptions.py`
   - `common_utils/tooling.py`

2. **API and Integration**
   - `api/utils/auth.py`
   - `api/routes/`
   - `api/middleware/`

3. **Utilities and Helpers**
   - `common_utils/logging/`
   - `common_utils/validation/`
   - `common_utils/secrets/`

4. **Development Tools**
   - `dev_tools/health_check.py`
   - `dev_tools/monitoring.py`

## Timeline

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Add tests for core functionality modules
   - Focus on reaching at least 40% coverage

2. **Medium-term (3-4 weeks)**
   - Add tests for API and integration modules
   - Focus on reaching at least 60% coverage

3. **Long-term (5-6 weeks)**
   - Add tests for utilities, helpers, and development tools
   - Ensure coverage meets the required 80% threshold

## Tracking Progress

Progress will be tracked by:
1. Regular coverage reports
2. Updates to this document
3. Monitoring progress towards the 80% coverage threshold

## Conclusion

Maintaining the 80% coverage threshold in our configuration files reinforces our commitment to high-quality code with comprehensive test coverage. The plan outlined in this document provides a roadmap for achieving and maintaining at least 80% test coverage across the codebase.
