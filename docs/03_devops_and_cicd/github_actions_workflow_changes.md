# GitHub Actions Workflow Changes

## Summary of Changes

We have consolidated the GitHub Actions workflows to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability. The following changes were made:

1. **Enhanced ci.yml**:
   - Added support for specific file and test path parameters
   - Added conditional execution for linting and testing steps based on specific file parameter
   - Incorporated type checking with pyright from lint_and_quality.yml
   - Made the workflow more configurable with additional input parameters

2. **Kept local-testing.yml**:
   - This workflow was already well-structured for local testing
   - It supports platform selection (Ubuntu/Windows)
   - It has options for specific file testing and custom test paths

3. **Removed redundant workflows**:
   - lint-and-test.yml (functionality merged into ci.yml)
   - lint_and_quality.yml (functionality merged into ci.yml)
   - run_tests.yml (functionality merged into ci.yml)
   - simple-lint.yml (functionality merged into local-testing.yml)
   - act-simple-lint.yml (functionality merged into local-testing.yml)
   - local-test.yml (functionality merged into local-testing.yml)
   - local-windows-test.yml (functionality merged into local-testing.yml)
   - act-local-test.yml (functionality merged into local-testing.yml)

4. **Updated helper scripts**:
   - Updated run_github_actions_locally.py to support the consolidated workflows
   - Added support for specific file and test path parameters in ci.yml

5. **Added documentation**:
   - Created github_actions_consolidation.md with detailed information about the consolidation
   - Updated PR description to include information about the workflow consolidation

## Remaining Workflows

After consolidation, we now have 4 workflows:

1. **ci.yml**: Comprehensive CI workflow for linting and testing
2. **local-testing.yml**: Unified local testing workflow
3. **security_scan.yml**: Specialized workflow for security scanning
4. **deploy.yml**: Specialized workflow for deployment tasks

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated overlapping workflows that performed similar functions
2. **Enhanced Configurability**: Added parameters to make workflows more flexible
3. **Consistent Tooling**: Ensured all linting and testing tools are consistently applied
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Fewer workflows to maintain and update
5. **Better Documentation**: Added comments and echo statements to improve workflow readability
