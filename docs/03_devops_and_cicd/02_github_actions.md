# GitHub Actions

This section describes our CI/CD implementation with GitHub Actions.

## Overview

- All CI, linting, coverage, and deployment workflows run via GitHub Actions.
- Uses Docker Buildx for reproducible builds.
- Handles security scans (Bandit, CodeQL, Trivy) and test coverage gates.
- Automated pre-commit and Ruff checks on push and PR.
- **Test Coverage Requirement**: Maintains 15% minimum test coverage across all workflows
- **Security Compliance**: All security scans must pass before merge

## Key Practices

- All workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`.
- Security scan and linting workflows must pass before merge.
- Local workflow dry-runs are documented in [github_actions_local_testing.md](../../github_actions_local_testing.md) (archived for advanced reference).
- See `run_github_actions_locally.py` for local workflow emulation.
- **Package Management**: Uses `uv` for Python dependencies and `pnpm` for JavaScript/Node.js
- **Test Exclusions**: Problematic test files and mock directories are properly excluded from CI runs

## Workflow Configuration

### Test Exclusions
The following files and directories are excluded from test collection to prevent CI failures:
- `tests/ai_models/adapters/test_mcp_adapter.py`
- `tests/test_mcp_import.py`
- `tests/test_mcp_top_level_import.py`
- `tests/test_crewai_agents.py`
- `tests/test_mem0_integration.py`
- `ai_models/artist_rl/test_artist_rl.py`
- `mock_mcp/`, `mock_crewai/`, `mock_mem0/` directories

### Security Scan Configuration
- **Bandit**: Configured with `.bandit` file to exclude test directories and skip common false positives (B101, B311)
- **Safety**: Scans Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **CodeQL**: Performs static analysis for security issues
- **Trivy**: Scans container images for vulnerabilities

### Coverage Requirements
- **Python**: 15% minimum coverage enforced via pytest with `--cov-fail-under=15`
- **JavaScript**: 80% minimum coverage enforced via nyc/Istanbul
- Coverage reports are generated in XML format for CI integration

## Troubleshooting & Fixes

- See [docs/07_troubleshooting_and_faq/troubleshooting.md](../07_troubleshooting_and_faq/troubleshooting.md) for common workflow issues and fixes.
- Historical fixes, optimization notes, and migration plans are archived in the [Archive & Notes](../09_archive_and_notes/claude_coding_best_practices.md).

## Recent Improvements (PR #139)

### Symlink Issues Resolution
- Removed all broken symlinks that were causing pytest collection errors
- Updated workflows to avoid creating problematic symlinks
- Implemented proper PYTHONPATH-based module resolution for mock modules

### Test Configuration Enhancements
- Updated `pytest.ini` and `pyproject.toml` with consistent asyncio configuration
- Added comprehensive test exclusion patterns
- Enhanced warning filters to suppress deprecation warnings

### Workflow Reliability Improvements
- Added multiple fallback strategies for test execution
- Enhanced CI wrapper scripts with better error handling
- Improved dependency caching and installation processes
