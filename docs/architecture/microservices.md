# pAIssive Income Microservices Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the microservices architecture for the pAIssive income project, identifying components suitable for microservices and defining the overall architectural approach.

## Motivation for Microservices

Adopting a microservices architecture provides several benefits for the pAIssive income project:

1. **Independent Scaling**: Different components have varying resource requirements; microservices allow us to scale each independently.
2. **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack.
3. **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work on different services independently.
4. **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't necessarily impact others.
5. **Deployment Independence**: Services can be deployed and updated independently.

## Component Analysis

Based on an analysis of the current monolithic application, we've identified the following components as suitable candidates for microservices:

### 1. AI Models Service

**Description**: Handles all AI model management, inference, versioning, and related operations.

**Current Components**:
- ai_models module

## Service Communication Patterns

1. **Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for direct request-response interactions
2. **Asynchronous Communication**: Message queue for event-driven communication
3. **Service Discovery**: For services to locate each other dynamically
4. **API Gateway**: Central entry point that routes requests to appropriate services

## Data Management Strategy

1. **Database per Service**: Each service manages its own data storage
2. **Eventual Consistency**: For data that needs to be shared between services
3. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: For services with complex query needs
4. **Event Sourcing**: For maintaining audit trails and handling complex state transitions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Service Identification and Design
- [x] Identify components suitable for microservices (this document)
- [ ] Define service boundaries and interfaces
- [ ] Design data management strategy for each service

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Set up containerization with Docker
- [ ] Configure Kubernetes for orchestration
- [ ] Implement service discovery
- [ ] Set up API gateway

### Phase 3: Service Implementation
- [ ] Extract services from the monolithic application
- [ ] Implement inter-service communication
- [ ] Set up databases for each service
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for each service
- [ ] Implement integration testing
- [ ] Perform load testing
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Service Boundaries**: Carefully defining service boundaries to minimize inter-service communication
2. **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across distributed data stores
3. **Monitoring**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring across services
4. **Testing**: Ensuring proper integration testing of the distributed system
5. **Deployment Complexity**: Managing deployment and orchestration of multiple services

## Next Steps

1. Define detailed API contracts for each service
2. Create detailed data models for each service
3. Set up infrastructure for containerization and orchestration
4. Begin incrementally extracting services from the monolith
