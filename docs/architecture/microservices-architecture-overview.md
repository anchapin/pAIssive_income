# pAIssive Income Microservices Architecture

## Overview

The pAIssive income platform is being redesigned with a microservices architecture to improve scalability, maintainability, and development velocity. This architecture breaks down the monolithic application into specialized, loosely-coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Service Independence**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each service focuses on a specific business capability
3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business domains
4. **API-First Development**: All services expose well-defined APIs
5. **Resilience**: Services are designed to be fault-tolerant and resilient
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging across all services
7. **Security by Design**: Security considerations at every architectural layer
8. **Eventual Consistency**: Data consistency across services is achieved over time
9. **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines for all services

## Core Services

### API Gateway Service
The API Gateway is the single entry point for all client requests, providing routing, authentication, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns. See [API Gateway Service Design](services/api-gateway-service.md) for details.

### Authentication Service
Handles user authentication, authorization, and identity management. See [Authentication Service Design](services/authentication-service.md) for details.

### Database Service
Provides a centralized data access layer, abstracting database technologies and ensuring consistent data access patterns. See [Database Service Design](services/database-service.md) for details.

### UI Service
Delivers the web-based user interface and client-side application. See [UI Service Design](services/ui-service.md) for details.

### AI Models Service
Manages AI model deployment, inference, and optimization. See [AI Models Service Design](services/ai-models-service.md) for details.

### Niche Analysis Service
Handles opportunity discovery, analysis, and comparison of niche markets. See [Niche Analysis Service Design](services/niche-analysis-service.md) for details.

### Marketing Service
Manages marketing strategy generation, content creation, and campaign planning. See [Marketing Service Design](services/marketing-service.md) for details.

### Monetization Service
Handles revenue projections, pricing strategies, and monetization planning. See [Monetization Service Design](services/monetization-service.md) for details.

### Agent Team Service
Orchestrates AI agent teams, their configurations, and interactions. See [Agent Team Service Design](services/agent-team-service.md) for details.

## Communication Patterns

The services communicate using several patterns:

1. **Synchronous REST API Calls**: For direct request-response interactions
2. **Asynchronous Messaging**: For decoupled service communication using message queues
3. **Event-Driven Communication**: For reactive updates and loose coupling
4. **Bulk Data Transfer**: For large data exchanges between services

## Data Management

### Data Ownership

Each microservice owns its domain-specific data. When data must be shared:

1. **Data Duplication**: Services maintain their own copy of required data
2. **Data Synchronization**: Services keep duplicated data in sync using events
3. **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency is maintained across service boundaries

### Database Technologies

- **MongoDB**: For document-based storage (niche analysis, marketing, agent teams)
- **PostgreSQL**: For relational data (user accounts, authentication, monetization)
- **Redis**: For caching and session storage
- **Vector Databases**: For AI model embeddings and semantic search

## Service Discovery and Configuration

- **Service Registry**: Services register themselves for discovery
- **Configuration Service**: Centralized configuration management
- **Environment-Specific Config**: Different configurations for development, testing, and production

## Deployment Model

### Containerization

All services are containerized using Docker with:
- Standard base images
- Environment-based configuration
- Health check endpoints
- Resource constraints
- Proper logging configuration

### Container Orchestration

Kubernetes is used for container orchestration with:
- Deployment definitions
- Service definitions
- Horizontal Pod Autoscalers
- Liveness and readiness probes
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Ingress controllers

### Deployment Pipeline

1. Code commit triggers CI pipeline
2. Automated tests run (unit, integration)
3. Code quality and security scanning
4. Build and push Docker images
5. Deploy to staging environment
6. Run acceptance tests
7. Deploy to production with canary or blue-green strategy

## Resilience Patterns

- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Retry Policies**: Automatically retry failed operations
- **Timeouts**: Prevent indefinite waiting
- **Bulkheads**: Isolate failures from spreading
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent service overload
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when services fail

## Observability

### Monitoring and Metrics

- **Service Metrics**: CPU, memory, request counts, latency
- **Business Metrics**: User activity, feature usage
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: Host-level metrics
- **Alerting**: Based on thresholds and anomaly detection

### Logging

- **Centralized Logging**: All logs sent to central repository
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with context
- **Log Correlation**: Request IDs across services
- **Log Levels**: Appropriate use of debug, info, warning, error

### Tracing

- **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across services
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks
- **Latency Tracking**: Monitor request processing time
- **Error Tracking**: Identify sources of failures

## Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **API Security**: Input validation, rate limiting
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Network Security**: Service isolation, firewall rules
- **Container Security**: Minimal images, non-root users
- **Secret Management**: Secure storage for credentials
- **Audit Logging**: Record of security-relevant events

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up containerization and orchestration
2. Implement API Gateway
3. Deploy Authentication Service
4. Deploy Database Service

### Phase 2: Service Migration
1. Port UI Service to microservices
