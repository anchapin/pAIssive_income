## Monitoring Webhook Health

### Dashboard Monitoring

The pAIssive Income platform provides a comprehensive webhook monitoring dashboard that allows you to:

- View the status of all webhook deliveries
- Track success and failure rates
- Monitor response times
- Identify patterns in webhook delivery issues

Access the dashboard at: `https://app.paissiveincome.com/dashboard/webhooks`

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Delivery Success Rate**: The percentage of webhook deliveries that are successfully received and processed by your endpoint.

2. **Response Time**: How long it takes for your endpoint to respond to webhook deliveries.

3. **Error Rate**: The percentage of webhook deliveries that result in errors.

4. **Retry Rate**: How often webhook deliveries need to be retried.

5. **Endpoint Availability**: Whether your webhook endpoint is consistently available to receive deliveries.

### Implementing Health Checks

Create a dedicated health check endpoint that the pAIssive Income platform can use to verify that your webhook receiver is operational:

```python
@app.route('/webhook-health', methods=['GET'])
def webhook_health():
    # Perform any necessary health checks
    database_healthy = check_database_connection()
    cache_healthy = check_cache_connection()
    
    if database_healthy and cache_healthy:
        return jsonify({"status": "healthy"}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({
            "status": "unhealthy",
            "details": {
                "database": database_healthy,
                "cache": cache_healthy
            }
        }), 500
```

## Handling Webhook Failures

### Implementing Idempotency

Webhook events may be delivered more than once, especially if retries occur. Implement idempotency to ensure that processing the same event multiple times doesn't cause issues:

```python
def process_webhook(event_data):
    event_id = event_data["id"]
    
    # Check if we've already processed this event
    if redis_client.exists(f"processed_event:{event_id}"):
        logger.info(f"Event {event_id} already processed, skipping")
        return
    
    # Process the event
    try:
        process_event_based_on_type(event_data)
        
        # Mark the event as processed (with a TTL of 24 hours)
        redis_client.setex(f"processed_event:{event_id}", 86400, "1")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error processing event {event_id}: {str(e)}")
        # Don't mark as processed if there was an error
        raise
```

### Dead Letter Queues

Implement a dead letter queue (DLQ) for events that repeatedly fail processing:

```python
def handle_webhook(request):
    try:
        # Verify signature and process webhook
        event_data = request.json
        process_webhook(event_data)
        return "OK", 200
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error
        logger.error(f"Error processing webhook: {str(e)}")
        
        # Add to dead letter queue for later inspection
        add_to_dead_letter_queue(request.json, str(e))
        
        # Still return 200 to acknowledge receipt
        return "Accepted but processing failed", 200
```

### Automatic Retry Logic

When your system encounters temporary failures processing webhook events, implement automatic retries with exponential backoff:

```python
def process_with_retry(event_data, max_retries=3):
    retries = 0
    while retries <= max_retries:
        try:
            process_webhook(event_data)
            return True
        except TemporaryError as e:
            retries += 1
            if retries > max_retries:
                logger.error(f"Max retries exceeded for event {event_data['id']}")
                add_to_dead_letter_queue(event_data, str(e))
                return False
            
            # Exponential backoff
            sleep_time = 2 ** retries
            logger.info(f"Retrying in {sleep_time} seconds...")
            time.sleep(sleep_time)
        except PermanentError as e:
            # Don't retry permanent errors
            logger.error(f"Permanent error for event {event_data['id']}: {str(e)}")
            add_to_dead_letter_queue(event_data, str(e))
            return False
```

## Setting Up Alerts

### Alert Types

Set up alerts for the following conditions:

1. **High Failure Rate**: Alert when the webhook failure rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 5%).

2. **Endpoint Downtime**: Alert when your webhook endpoint is unreachable.

3. **Response Time Degradation**: Alert when response times increase significantly.

4. **Dead Letter Queue Growth**: Alert when the DLQ grows beyond a certain size.

5. **Rate Limit Approaching**: Alert when you're approaching your webhook rate limits.

### Alert Configuration

Configure alerts in your monitoring system with appropriate thresholds and notification channels:

```yaml
# Example Prometheus alerting rule
groups:
- name: webhook_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: WebhookHighFailureRate
    expr: rate(webhook_delivery_failures_total[5m]) / rate(webhook_deliveries_total[5m]) > 0.05
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High webhook failure rate"
      description: "Webhook failure rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} over the last 5 minutes"
  
  - alert: WebhookEndpointDown
    expr: up{job="webhook-endpoint"} == 0
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Webhook endpoint is down"
      description: "The webhook endpoint has been down for more than 2 minutes"
```

### Notification Channels

Set up multiple notification channels to ensure alerts are seen promptly:

- Email notifications
- SMS alerts for critical issues
- Integration with incident management systems (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)
- Slack/Teams notifications for team visibility

## Implementing Redundancy

### Multiple Webhook Endpoints

Register multiple webhook endpoints for critical events to ensure redundancy:

```json
// Register primary webhook
POST /api/v1/webhooks
{
  "url": "https://primary.example.com/webhook",
  "events": ["payment.received", "subscription.created"],
  "description": "Primary payment webhook"
}

// Register backup webhook
POST /api/v1/webhooks
{
  "url": "https://backup.example.com/webhook",
  "events": ["payment.received", "subscription.created"],
  "description": "Backup payment webhook"
}
```

### Webhook Fanout

Implement a webhook fanout pattern where a primary webhook receiver distributes events to multiple internal services:

```python
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook_receiver():
    # Verify signature
    if not verify_signature(request):
        return "Invalid signature", 401
    
    # Log the incoming webhook
    event_data = request.json
    event_id = event_data["id"]
    event_type = event_data["type"]
    
    # Store the event in the database
    store_event(event_data)
    
    # Asynchronously distribute to internal services
    if event_type == "payment.received":
        enqueue_task("process_payment", event_data)
        enqueue_task("update_analytics", event_data)
        enqueue_task("notify_customer", event_data)
    elif event_type == "subscription.created":
        enqueue_task("provision_subscription", event_data)
        enqueue_task("update_billing", event_data)
    
    return "OK", 200
```

### Geographic Distribution

For mission-critical systems, deploy webhook receivers in multiple geographic regions to ensure availability even during regional outages.

## Analyzing Webhook Performance

### Performance Metrics

Track the following performance metrics for your webhook system:

1. **End-to-End Latency**: Time from event occurrence to completion of processing.

2. **Processing Time**: Time spent processing each webhook event.

3. **Queue Time**: Time events spend waiting in queues before processing.

4. **Throughput**: Number of webhook events processed per minute/hour.

### Performance Dashboard

Create a performance dashboard that visualizes these metrics over time:

```python
# Example Prometheus metrics for webhook performance
def process_webhook(event_data):
    event_id = event_data["id"]
    event_type = event_data["type"]
    
    # Record processing time
    with PROCESSING_TIME.labels(event_type=event_type).time():
        # Process the event
        result = process_event_based_on_type(event_data)
    
    # Increment counter for processed events
    EVENTS_PROCESSED.labels(event_type=event_type, status="success").inc()
    
    # Record end-to-end latency
    event_time = datetime.fromisoformat(event_data["created_at"].replace("Z", "+00:00"))
    latency_seconds = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - event_time).total_seconds()
    END_TO_END_LATENCY.labels(event_type=event_type).observe(latency_seconds)
    
    return result

# Define metrics
PROCESSING_TIME = Summary('webhook_processing_seconds', 'Time spent processing webhooks', ['event_type'])
EVENTS_PROCESSED = Counter('webhook_events_processed_total', 'Total webhook events processed', ['event_type', 'status'])
END_TO_END_LATENCY = Histogram('webhook_end_to_end_seconds', 'End-to-end webhook latency', ['event_type'])
```

## Scaling Webhook Infrastructure

### Horizontal Scaling

Design your webhook processing system to scale horizontally:

1. **Stateless Receivers**: Ensure webhook receivers are stateless and can be scaled out.

2. **Queue-Based Processing**: Use message queues to decouple webhook receipt from processing.

3. **Auto-Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling based on queue depth and processing latency.

```python
# Example architecture with Flask and Celery
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from celery import Celery

app = Flask(__name__)
celery = Celery('webhooks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook_receiver():
    # Verify signature
    if not verify_signature(request):
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid signature"}), 401
    
    # Queue the event for processing
    event_data = request.json
    process_webhook.delay(event_data)
    
    # Return immediately
    return jsonify({"status": "accepted"}), 202

@celery.task
def process_webhook(event_data):
    # Process the webhook event
    event_type = event_data["type"]
    
    if event_type == "payment.received":
        process_payment(event_data)
    elif event_type == "subscription.created":
        process_subscription(event_data)
    # ... handle other event types
```

### Load Testing

Regularly perform load testing to ensure your webhook infrastructure can handle peak loads:

1. **Simulate Peak Traffic**: Generate webhook events at 2-3x your expected peak volume.

2. **Measure Performance**: Track processing times, error rates, and resource utilization.

3. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Find and address performance bottlenecks before they affect production.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Signature Verification Failures

If webhook signature verification is failing:

1. Check that you're using the correct webhook secret.
2. Ensure you're verifying the raw request body without modifications.
3. Verify that your signature calculation matches our algorithm (HMAC-SHA256).
4. Check for character encoding issues in the request body.

### Timeouts

If webhook deliveries are timing out:

1. Optimize your webhook handler to respond quickly (under 10 seconds).
2. Move time-consuming processing to background tasks.
3. Check for database or external API calls that might be slowing down your handler.
4. Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, database connections) for bottlenecks.

### Rate Limiting

If you're hitting rate limits:

1. Implement request throttling on your side.
2. Consider batching webhook processing during high-volume periods.
3. Contact support to discuss increasing your rate limits if needed.

### Debugging Tools

Use these tools to debug webhook issues:

1. **Webhook Logs**: Access detailed logs for each webhook delivery in the dashboard.

2. **Webhook Tester**: Use our webhook tester to send test events to your endpoint.

3. **Request ID Tracing**: Each webhook includes a unique request ID that can be used for tracing.

```python
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook_handler():
    request_id = request.headers.get('X-Request-ID')
    logger.info(f"Received webhook with request ID: {request_id}")
    
    # Process webhook
    # ...
    
    # Include request ID in your logs for tracing
    logger.info(f"Completed processing webhook {request_id}")
    return "OK", 200
```

### Common Error Patterns

Watch for these common error patterns:

1. **Intermittent 5xx Errors**: Often indicates resource constraints or downstream dependencies failing.

2. **Consistent 4xx Errors**: Usually indicates configuration issues like invalid URLs or authentication.

3. **Increasing Response Times**: May indicate performance degradation or resource contention.

4. **Periodic Failures**: Could indicate maintenance windows or cron jobs affecting your infrastructure.
