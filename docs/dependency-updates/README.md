# Dependency Updates Documentation

This directory contains documentation for significant dependency updates in the project. Each file documents a specific dependency update, including:

- The package being updated
- Version changes
- Impact assessment
- Testing performed
- Implementation details
- References to relevant resources

## Purpose

The documentation in this directory serves several purposes:

1. **Tracking Changes**: Provides a historical record of dependency updates
2. **Impact Assessment**: Documents the potential impact of each update on the system
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Helps team members understand why and how dependencies were updated
4. **Compliance**: Assists with audit and compliance requirements by documenting changes

## File Naming Convention

Files in this directory follow the naming convention:

```
{package-name}-{version}.md
```

For example:
- `postcss-8.4.32.md` - Documents the update to PostCSS version 8.4.32

## Contents

Each dependency update document should include:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the update
2. **Update Details**: Package name, version changes, and location
3. **Changes**: Summary of changes in the new version
4. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of the update's impact on the system
5. **Testing**: Description of testing performed to validate the update
6. **Implementation**: Details of how the update was implemented
7. **References**: Links to relevant resources (release notes, changelogs, etc.)

## Adding New Documentation

When adding documentation for a new dependency update:

1. Create a new file following the naming convention
2. Include all required sections
3. Be specific about the impact and testing performed
4. Add links to relevant resources for further information
