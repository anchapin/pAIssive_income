# Machine Learning Log Analysis

The logging dashboard includes advanced machine learning capabilities for analyzing log data. This document provides an overview of the machine learning features and how to use them.

## Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns and outliers in log data
- **Pattern Recognition**: Discover recurring patterns in log messages
- **Log Clustering**: Group similar log messages together
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze trends in log data over time

2. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model on normal log data
3. **Anomaly Scoring**: Score new log entries based on their deviation from normal patterns
4. **Threshold-Based Detection**: Flag entries with scores above a certain threshold as anomalies

### Using Anomaly Detection

To use the anomaly detection feature:

1. Navigate to the "ML Analysis" tab
2. Click "Run ML Analysis"

- **Examples**: Example log messages from the cluster
- **Centroid**: The central point of the cluster in feature space

## Trend Analysis

The trend analysis feature uses machine learning algorithms to analyze trends in log data over time. It can identify:

- Increasing error rates
- Decreasing performance
- Changing log patterns
- Seasonal variations
- Long-term trends

### How It Works

The trend analysis system uses time series analysis techniques:

1. **Time Series Extraction**: Extract time series from log data

## Predictive Analytics

The predictive analytics feature uses machine learning algorithms to predict future log patterns and potential issues. It can predict:

- Future error rates
- Performance degradation
- Resource utilization
- System failures
- Security incidents

### How It Works

The predictive analytics system uses supervised learning techniques:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from historical log data
