# Docker Compose Workflow Optimizations

This document describes the optimizations implemented in the Docker Compose workflow to improve CI/CD performance.

## Overview

The Docker Compose workflow has been optimized to significantly reduce execution time in CI/CD pipelines. These optimizations focus on improving build speed, resource utilization, and overall efficiency.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. BuildKit Enhancements

- Enabled Docker BuildKit with improved caching
- Added BuildKit configuration for faster builds:
  ```yaml
  DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1
  COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD: 1
  BUILDKIT_PROGRESS: plain
  BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE: 1
  ```
- Configured BuildKit to use optimized settings for CI environments

### 2. Parallel Processing

- Implemented parallel image pulling
- Added parallel service startup
- Enabled parallel test execution for backend and frontend
- Configured parallel log collection and resource cleanup

### 3. Resource Optimization

- Added aggressive cleanup of unused Docker resources
- Optimized memory and CPU allocation
- Reduced disk space usage by removing unnecessary packages
- Implemented optimized Docker configuration:
  ```json
  {
    "builder": { "gc": { "enabled": true, "defaultKeepStorage": "20GB" } },
    "experimental": true,
    "features": { "buildkit": true },
    "registry-mirrors": ["https://mirror.gcr.io"]
  }
  ```

### 4. CI-Specific Configuration

- Created a dedicated `docker-compose.ci.yml` for CI environments
- Optimized PostgreSQL settings for CI:
  ```yaml
  # Use tmpfs for faster database in CI
  tmpfs:
    - /var/lib/postgresql/data
  # Optimize PostgreSQL for CI
  command: postgres -c fsync=off -c synchronous_commit=off -c full_page_writes=off -c max_connections=200
  ```
- Reduced health check intervals and timeouts:
  ```yaml
  healthcheck:
    interval: 2s
    timeout: 2s
    retries: 15
    start_period: 2s
  ```

### 5. Workflow Improvements

- Optimized runner preparation with targeted cleanup
- Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Added performance tracking and metrics
- Implemented early exit strategies for faster completion

## Implementation Details

### Optimized Docker Compose Script

The `scripts/run-docker-compose-ci.sh` script has been enhanced with:

1. Parallel image pulling with fallback mechanisms
2. Optimized service startup and health checks
3. Improved error handling and recovery
4. Performance tracking and metrics

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/docker-compose.yml` workflow has been optimized with:

1. Enhanced runner preparation
2. Optimized Docker configuration
3. Parallel execution of tasks
4. Improved resource cleanup

## Benefits

- **Reduced Execution Time**: Significantly faster CI/CD pipeline execution
- **Improved Reliability**: Better error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized resource utilization
- **Cost Reduction**: Lower GitHub Actions minutes consumption

## Usage

These optimizations are automatically applied when running the Docker Compose workflow in CI environments. No additional configuration is required.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the optimized workflow:

1. Check the logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that Docker BuildKit is properly enabled
3. Ensure sufficient resources are available on the runner
4. Review the parallel execution settings if tasks are failing
