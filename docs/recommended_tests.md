## Implementation Notes

Priority should be given to:
1. Cross-Module Workflow Tests - these represent critical user paths
2. Security Testing - essential for production readiness
3. Performance Testing - important for scalability
4. Error Recovery Tests - crucial for system reliability

Many of these tests would benefit from property-based testing approaches to catch edge cases and from chaos engineering principles to verify system resilience.
