## Technical Questions

### How do I install the pAIssive Income Framework?

You can install the pAIssive Income Framework by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anchapin/pAIssive_income.git
cd pAIssive_income
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For more detailed installation instructions, see the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.

### How do I run the web interface?

You can run the web interface with the following command:

```bash
python run_ui.py
```

This will start a web server at http://localhost:5000 where you can access the UI.

### Can I use my own AI models with the framework?

Yes, you can use your own AI models with the framework. The AI Models module provides a unified interface for working with different types of models and adapters. You can register your own models with the Model Manager:

```python
from ai_models import ModelManager, ModelInfo

manager = ModelManager()
model_info = ModelInfo(
    id="my-model",
    name="My Model",
    description="My custom AI model",
    model_type="text",
    path="/path/to/my/model"
)
manager.register_model(model_info)
```

### How do I create a custom agent?

You can create a custom agent by extending the base Agent class:

```python
from agent_team import Agent

class MyCustomAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name, config=None):
        super().__init__(name, config)
        
    def process(self, input_data):
        # Process the input data
        # ...
        return result
```

Then you can add your custom agent to the Agent Team:

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam

team = AgentTeam("My Team")
team.add_agent(MyCustomAgent("My Custom Agent"))
```

## Business Questions

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam

team = AgentTeam("My Team")
niches = team.run_niche_analysis(["e-commerce", "content creation", "freelancing"])
```

### How do I create a subscription model?

The framework includes a Monetization module that can help you create subscription models. It provides classes for creating and managing different subscription models, including freemium models, tiered models, and usage-based models.

You can use the Monetization Agent to create a monetization strategy:

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam

team = AgentTeam("My Team")
monetization_strategy = team.create_monetization_strategy(solution_id)
```

### How do I market my AI tool?

The framework includes a Marketing module that can help you create marketing strategies and content. It provides tools for creating user personas, developing channel strategies, and generating marketing content.

You can use the Marketing Agent to create a marketing campaign:

```python
from agent_team import AgentTeam

team = AgentTeam("My Team")
marketing_campaign = team.create_marketing_campaign(solution_id, monetization_strategy_id)
```
