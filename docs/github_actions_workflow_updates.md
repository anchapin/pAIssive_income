# GitHub Actions Workflow Updates

## Overview

This document summarizes the recent updates to the GitHub Actions workflows in the project. These updates improve security scanning, frontend testing, and development environment setup.

## CodeQL Security Analysis

### New Platform-Specific Workflows

We've added platform-specific CodeQL workflows to enhance security analysis across different operating systems:

1. **codeql-macos.yml**: Runs CodeQL analysis on macOS
2. **codeql-ubuntu.yml**: Runs CodeQL analysis on Ubuntu
3. **codeql-windows.yml**: Runs CodeQL analysis on Windows
4. **codeql.yml**: Base workflow with common configuration

### Key Improvements

- **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Identifies platform-specific security issues
- **Multi-Language Support**: Analyzes both JavaScript/TypeScript and Python code
- **Robust Dependency Installation**: Uses `uv pip` with fallback to regular `pip`
- **Caching and Performance Optimization**: Caches CodeQL databases and dependencies
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed SARIF reports for each language and platform

For detailed information, see [CodeQL Workflows](security/codeql_workflows.md).

## Frontend Testing

### Vitest Unit Testing

The `frontend-vitest.yml` workflow has been updated with:

- **Node.js 20.x Support**: Updated to use the latest Node.js LTS version
- **PNPM Integration**: Uses pnpm/action-setup@v4 for package management
- **PATH Configuration**: Properly adds pnpm to the PATH environment variable
- **Verification Steps**: Checks pnpm installation and version
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of test failures

For detailed information, see [Vitest Framework](frontend/vitest-framework.md).

### End-to-End Testing

The `frontend-e2e.yml` workflow has been updated with:

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Can run on Ubuntu, Windows, or both
- **Backend API Integration**: Automatically starts and verifies the backend API
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retries failed tests
- **Artifact Collection**: Uploads test reports and screenshots
- **Error Handling**: Proper cleanup of processes even on failure

For detailed information, see [E2E Testing](frontend/e2e-testing.md).

## Development Environment Setup

### Reusable PNPM Setup

The `setup-pnpm.yml` workflow has been created as a reusable workflow with:

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Ubuntu and Windows
- **Configurable Options**: Customizable Node.js and PNPM versions
- **Platform-Specific Setup**: Handles PATH configuration for each platform
- **Robust Error Handling**: Verifies installation and provides fallbacks
- **Package.json Management**: Can create a minimal package.json if missing

For detailed information, see [Setup PNPM Workflow](ci_cd/setup-pnpm.md).

### Test Setup Script

The `test-setup-script.yml` workflow has been updated to:

- **Test Multiple Platforms**: Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- **Test Different Profiles**: Full, minimal, UI-only, and backend-only
- **Verify Installation**: Checks installed tools and dependencies
- **Support Manual Triggering**: Can be run manually with configurable options

For detailed information, see [Test Setup Script Workflow](ci_cd/test-setup-script.md).

## Benefits of These Updates

### Improved Security

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Security analysis across multiple platforms and languages
- **Early Detection**: Identifies security issues before they reach production
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides detailed information about security issues

### Enhanced Testing

- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tests across different browsers and platforms
- **Integration Testing**: Tests frontend and backend integration
- **Reliable Results**: Reduces flaky tests with retry mechanisms

### Streamlined Development

- **Reusable Workflows**: Reduces duplication and improves maintainability
- **Robust Setup**: Ensures consistent development environments
- **Efficient Package Management**: Uses PNPM for faster and more efficient package management

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Update**: Regularly review and update workflows as needed
2. **Add More Tests**: Expand test coverage for critical components
3. **Optimize Performance**: Continue to optimize workflow performance
4. **Enhance Reporting**: Improve reporting and visualization of results
