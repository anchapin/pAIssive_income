# Node.js Version Update

This document outlines the update of Node.js from version 18 to version 24 in the frontend Docker configuration.

## Overview

As part of our dependency maintenance strategy, we've updated the Node.js version used in our frontend Docker container from 18-alpine to 24-alpine. This update ensures we're using the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js, which provides improved performance, security, and features.

## Changes Made

- Updated `ui/react_frontend/Dockerfile.dev` to use `node:24-alpine` instead of `node:18-alpine`
- Updated related CI/CD workflows to support Node.js 24

## Benefits

1. **Security Improvements**: Node.js 24 includes the latest security patches and improvements
2. **Performance Enhancements**: Newer versions of Node.js offer better performance and memory management
3. **Modern JavaScript Features**: Support for the latest ECMAScript features
4. **Dependency Compatibility**: Better compatibility with modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks

## Compatibility Considerations

When upgrading Node.js versions, consider the following:

1. **Package Compatibility**: Some packages may have specific Node.js version requirements
2. **Build Process**: Ensure your build process is compatible with Node.js 24
3. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Update CI/CD configurations to use Node.js 24 where applicable

## Testing

After upgrading Node.js, ensure that:

1. The application builds successfully
2. All tests pass
3. The application runs as expected in development and production environments
