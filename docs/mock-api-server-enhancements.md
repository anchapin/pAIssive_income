# Mock API Server Enhancements for CI Compatibility

This document describes the enhancements made to the Mock API Server to improve compatibility with CI environments.

## Overview

The Mock API Server has been enhanced to better support CI environments, particularly GitHub Actions. These enhancements improve the reliability and performance of tests running in CI environments.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Fixed Path-to-Regexp Error

The path-to-regexp library was causing errors in the mock API server when running in CI environments. This has been fixed by:

- Adding proper error handling for path-to-regexp initialization
- Implementing a fallback mechanism when path-to-regexp fails
- Adding environment-specific path matching to handle different CI environments

### 2. Updated Error Handling in Mock API Server Tests

Error handling in the mock API server tests has been improved to:

- Provide more detailed error messages
- Add better logging for debugging in CI environments
- Implement proper catch method usage in simple_test.spec.ts

### 3. Enhanced Logging for CI Environments

Logging has been enhanced for CI environments to:

- Include more detailed environment information
- Add timestamps to log messages
- Provide better context for errors
- Support different log levels based on the environment

### 4. Improved Error Handling for URL Parsing

URL parsing error handling has been improved to:

- Handle malformed URLs gracefully
- Provide better error messages for URL parsing failures
- Add fallback mechanisms for URL parsing errors

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Docker Environment Report

The Docker environment detection has been enhanced to:

- Support Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes detection
- Include more detailed environment information in the Docker report
- Provide better diagnostics for Docker-related issues

### 2. Enhanced CI Environment Tests

CI environment detection has been improved to support:

- GitHub Actions
- Jenkins
- GitLab CI
- CircleCI
- Travis CI
- Azure Pipelines
- TeamCity
- Bitbucket
- AppVeyor
- Drone
- Buddy
- Buildkite
- AWS CodeBuild

### 3. Enhanced Mock Server

The mock server has been enhanced to:

- Handle environment-specific routes
- Add environment-specific response handling
- Include more detailed environment information

### 4. Enhanced Path-to-Regexp

The path-to-regexp module has been enhanced to:

- Support environment-specific path matching
- Include more detailed environment information

### 5. Enhanced E2E Test Scripts

The E2E test scripts have been enhanced to:

- Detect and handle different environments
- Add environment-specific configuration options
- Include more detailed environment information in test reports

### 6. Enhanced GitHub Workflow Files

The GitHub workflow files have been enhanced to:

- Use enhanced environment detection
- Add environment-specific configuration options

## Testing

All tests now pass in the CI environment, demonstrating the improved compatibility and reliability of the mock API server.

## Future Work

Future enhancements could include:

- Additional CI platform support
- More detailed environment reporting
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases
- Performance optimizations for CI environments
