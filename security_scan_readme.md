# Security Scan Workflow

This document provides information about the enhanced security scan workflow for the pAIssive_income project.

## Overview

The security scan workflow is designed to identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase and dependencies. It runs the following security tools:

1. **Safety**: Checks for known vulnerabilities in Python dependencies
2. **Bandit**: Static analysis tool for Python code to find common security issues
3. **Trivy**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and filesystems
4. **npm audit**: Checks for vulnerabilities in Node.js dependencies (if applicable)

## Workflow Enhancements

The security scan workflow has been enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Robust Tool Installation**: The workflow now includes retry mechanisms and verification steps to ensure that security tools are properly installed.

2. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error handling for tool execution, JSON validation, and SARIF conversion.

3. **SARIF File Optimization**: Large SARIF files are automatically reduced in size to prevent GitHub upload issues.

4. **Compressed Artifacts**: Security reports are compressed for more efficient storage as GitHub artifacts.

5. **Node.js Dependency Scanning**: Added npm audit for checking Node.js dependencies.

6. **Dependency Review**: Enhanced dependency review for pull requests.

## Running the Workflow

### GitHub Actions

The workflow runs automatically on:
- Push to main, master, or develop branches
- Pull requests targeting main, master, or develop branches
- Weekly schedule (Sundays at midnight)
- Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch

### Local Testing

You can test the security scan workflow locally using the provided `test_security_scan.py` script:

```bash
# Test all components
python test_security_scan.py --all

# Test specific components
python test_security_scan.py --safety
python test_security_scan.py --bandit
python test_security_scan.py --sarif
```

## Workflow Output

The workflow produces the following outputs:

1. **Security Reports**: JSON and log files containing the raw output from security tools.
2. **SARIF Reports**: SARIF-formatted reports for GitHub Code Scanning integration.
3. **Compressed Reports**: Gzipped versions of the reports for efficient storage.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Safety Command Not Found**:
   - The workflow will automatically attempt to reinstall Safety.
   - If that fails, it will fall back to using pip-audit.

2. **Bandit Scan Issues**:
   - The workflow will try running Bandit with different options if the initial scan fails.
   - If Bandit cannot be installed or run, the workflow will continue with empty results.

3. **SARIF File Size Exceeded**:
   - Large SARIF files are automatically reduced by limiting the number of results.
   - Compressed versions are always available as artifacts.

4. **Invalid JSON Output**:
   - The workflow validates JSON output and creates valid empty files as fallbacks.

### Manual Fixes

If you encounter persistent issues with the security scan workflow:

1. **Check Tool Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install safety bandit pip-audit
   ```

2. **Verify SARIF Conversion**:
   ```bash
   python sarif_utils.py input.json output.sarif ToolName https://tool-url.com
   ```

3. **Run npm Audit** (if using Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```

## Interpreting Results

### Safety Results

Safety reports vulnerabilities in Python dependencies with the following information:
- Package name
- Vulnerable version
- Safe version
- Vulnerability description
- CVE identifier (if available)

### Bandit Results

Bandit reports security issues in Python code with the following information:
- Issue type (e.g., hardcoded password, SQL injection)
- Confidence level
- Severity level
- File path and line number
- Code snippet

### Trivy Results

Trivy reports vulnerabilities in various components with the following information:
- Target (e.g., filesystem, container image)
- Vulnerability ID
- Package name
- Installed version
- Fixed version
- Severity

### npm Audit Results

npm audit reports vulnerabilities in Node.js dependencies with the following information:
- Package name
- Vulnerable version range
- Patched version
- Dependency path
- Severity level
- CVE identifier (if available)

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up-to-date to minimize vulnerabilities.
2. **Code Reviews**: Pay attention to security issues flagged during code reviews.
3. **Fix Critical Issues**: Address critical security issues immediately.
4. **Dependency Management**: Use dependency locking and automated updates (e.g., Dependabot).
5. **Security Testing**: Include security testing in your development workflow.
