# CodeQL Workflow Fix

## Issue Description

The CodeQL workflow was failing with the following error:

```
[detached HEAD acb9cb5] Fix CodeQL issues
 1 file changed, 47 insertions(+), 47 deletions(-)
fatal: You are not currently on a branch.
To push the history leading to the current (detached HEAD)
state now, use

    git push origin HEAD:<name-of-remote-branch>

Error: Process completed with exit code 128.
```

This error occurs because the GitHub Action was running in a detached HEAD state and attempting to push changes without specifying a target branch.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to the `.github/workflows/fix-codeql-issues.yml` file:

1. **Improved Repository Checkout**:
   - Added `ref: ${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}` to the checkout action to ensure we're on a proper branch
   - This ensures the workflow checks out the PR branch or the pushed branch instead of a detached HEAD

2. **Enhanced Git Push Logic**:
   - Added logic to detect if we're in a detached HEAD state
   - Improved the git push command to use `git push origin HEAD:$BRANCH_NAME`
   - Added proper error handling and status messages

3. **Updated Permissions**:
   - Added `actions: write` permission to ensure the workflow has sufficient permissions to push changes

## Testing

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that:
1. The workflow checks out a proper branch reference
2. The git push command works correctly even in a detached HEAD state
3. The workflow has the necessary permissions to push changes

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the workflow to ensure it runs successfully
2. If issues persist, consider additional debugging steps such as:
   - Adding more verbose output to the git commands
   - Checking GitHub token permissions
   - Verifying branch protection rules
