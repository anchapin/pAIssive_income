        Analyze price sensitivity for a product using economic price elasticity modeling.

        This algorithm implements a practical application of price elasticity of demand concepts
        to identify the revenue-maximizing price point for a product or service. The process
        follows a systematic workflow:

        1. PRICE POINT GENERATION:
           - Creates a spectrum of price points around the base price (50%-150% range)
           - This range allows analysis of both discounting and premium pricing effects

        2. DEMAND MODELING WITH ELASTICITY:
           - For each price point, calculates expected demand using price elasticity formula
           - Uses the inverse power relationship: demand ~ (1/price)^elasticity
           - Accurately models how demand decreases as prices increase (and vice versa)

        3. REVENUE CALCULATION:
           - For each price-demand pair, calculates the projected revenue
           - Revenue = Price × Demand
           - This identifies the trade-off between higher prices and lower volume

        4. OPTIMAL PRICE IDENTIFICATION:
           - Identifies the price point that maximizes total revenue
           - Balances the competing effects of price and demand

        5. COMPREHENSIVE RESULT COMPILATION:
           - Creates a structured analysis result with all price points and the optimal solution
           - Includes timestamp and unique ID for tracking and referencing

        The algorithm's sophistication comes from its use of price elasticity modeling:
        - When elasticity = 1.0 (unit elastic): revenue remains constant as price changes
        - When elasticity > 1.0 (elastic): lower prices increase total revenue
        - When elasticity < 1.0 (inelastic): higher prices increase total revenue

        This approach provides data-driven guidance for pricing decisions that maximizes
        revenue based on market conditions and customer behavior patterns.

        Calculate the optimal price for a subscription tier using a hybrid pricing model.

        This algorithm implements a sophisticated multi-strategy pricing approach that
        blends three fundamental pricing methodologies to determine an optimal price point.
        The process follows a systematic workflow:

        1. CALCULATION OF STRATEGY-SPECIFIC PRICES:
           - Cost-Plus Pricing: Based on costs and target profit margins
           - Value-Based Pricing: Based on perceived customer value relative to competitors
           - Competitor-Based Pricing: Based on market positioning relative to competitors,
             adjusted for customer price sensitivity

        2. STRATEGIC WEIGHTING SYSTEM:
           - Different weights are applied to each pricing approach based on the selected
             pricing strategy (value-based, competitor-based, or cost-plus)
           - This creates a customized pricing model that emphasizes the most relevant
             factors for the specific market and product positioning

        3. WEIGHTED AGGREGATION:
           - The final price is calculated as a weighted average of the three approaches
           - This balances internal factors (costs, margins) with external factors
             (market positioning, customer value perception)

        4. PRICING PSYCHOLOGY OPTIMIZATION:
           - The calculated price is adjusted to end in .99 for psychological pricing effect
           - Special cases are handled to maintain pricing consistency across tiers

        The algorithm provides powerful flexibility through its parameterized inputs:
        - Higher value_perception increases the value-based component
        - Higher price_sensitivity reduces the competitor-based price to be more competitive
        - Different pricing_strategy settings adjust the weights to emphasize different factors

        This hybrid approach helps avoid the pitfalls of any single pricing methodology:
        - Not just cost-based (which ignores market conditions)
        - Not just value-based (which might ignore profitability)
        - Not just competitor-based (which might lead to price wars)

            tier_name: Name of the tier (e.g., "Basic", "Pro", "Enterprise")

                              where 1.0 means equal or higher value than competitors
            competitor_price: Average market price for similar offerings in this tier
            price_sensitivity: How sensitive customers are to price changes (0-1 scale)
