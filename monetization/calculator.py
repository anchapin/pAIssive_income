        Calculate subscription revenue across multiple pricing tiers.

        This algorithm performs a comprehensive revenue calculation by analyzing each
        subscription tier and its associated user base. The calculation workflow follows
        a multi - stage process:

        1. INITIALIZATION:
           - Create structures for tracking tier - specific revenue details
           - Initialize accumulators for user counts and revenue totals

        2. TIER - BY - TIER ANALYSIS:
           - For each pricing tier, extract key attributes (ID, name, price)
           - Look up the corresponding user count for that tier
           - Calculate tier - specific revenue (price Ã— user count)
           - Aggregate metrics into the running totals
           - Store tier - specific details for reporting

        3. DERIVATION OF KEY METRICS:
           - Calculate Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) as total revenue / total users
           - Handle edge case when total users is zero to prevent division by zero

        4. COMPREHENSIVE RESULT GENERATION:
           - Create a structured report containing tier - specific breakdowns
           - Include aggregate metrics like total revenue, total users, and ARPU
           - Provide detailed logging for debugging and tracking

        5. ERROR HANDLING AND SAFETY:
           - Validate tier data integrity (e.g., check for missing tier IDs)
           - \
               Use a try - except pattern to catch and properly report any calculation errors
           - \
               Transform unexpected errors into domain - specific MonetizationError objects

        The algorithm is designed to handle multiple subscription models including:
