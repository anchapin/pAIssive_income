# Monetization

This directory contains tools and templates for monetizing AI-powered software tools through subscription models and other revenue streams.

## Overview

The monetization module is organized into three main components:

1. **Subscription Models**: Templates for different subscription models and pricing tiers
2. **Pricing Calculator**: Tools to calculate optimal pricing for your products
3. **Revenue Projector**: Tools to project revenue based on different scenarios

## Subscription Models

The `subscription_models.py` module provides templates for different subscription models, including:

- Freemium model (free tier + paid tiers)
- Tiered subscription model (basic, pro, premium)
- Usage-based model (pay per use)
- Hybrid models (combination of the above)

Each model includes:

- Tier definitions
- Feature allocation
- Pricing structure
- Billing cycle options

## Pricing Calculator

The `pricing_calculator.py` module provides tools to calculate optimal pricing for your products, including:

- Value-based pricing calculator
- Competitor-based pricing calculator
- Cost-plus pricing calculator
- Price sensitivity analyzer
- Price optimization tools

## Revenue Projector

The `revenue_projector.py` module provides tools to project revenue based on different scenarios, including:

- User acquisition projections
- Conversion rate projections
- Churn rate projections
- Lifetime value calculations
- Cash flow projections

## Usage

To use these tools, import the relevant modules and call the functions with your specific parameters.

Example:

```python
from monetization.subscription_models import TieredSubscriptionModel
from monetization.pricing_calculator import ValueBasedPricing
from monetization.revenue_projector import RevenueProjector

# Create a tiered subscription model
subscription_model = TieredSubscriptionModel(
    tiers=[
        {"name": "Basic", "features": ["feature1", "feature2"]},
        {"name": "Pro", "features": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3", "feature4"]},
        {"name": "Premium", "features": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3", "feature4", "feature5", "feature6"]},
    ]
)

# Calculate optimal pricing
pricing_calculator = ValueBasedPricing(
    problem_value=500,  # The value of the problem being solved
    solution_effectiveness=0.8,  # How effectively the solution solves the problem
    competitor_prices=[10, 15, 20],  # Competitor prices
)

optimal_prices = pricing_calculator.calculate_optimal_prices(subscription_model)

# Project revenue
revenue_projector = RevenueProjector(
    initial_users=0,
    user_acquisition_rate=50,  # New users per month
    conversion_rate=0.2,  # Free to paid conversion rate
    churn_rate=0.05,  # Monthly churn rate
    subscription_model=subscription_model,
    prices=optimal_prices,
)

revenue_projection = revenue_projector.project_revenue(months=36)  # 3-year projection

print(f"Optimal prices: {optimal_prices}")
print(f"3-year revenue projection: ${revenue_projection['total_revenue']}")
```

## Customization

These tools are designed to be customized for your specific niche and solution. Look for comments marked with `TODO` for guidance on what to customize.

## Dependencies

The tools have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

Additional dependencies are listed in each module file.
