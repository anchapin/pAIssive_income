# Monetization

This directory contains tools and templates for monetizing AI-powered software tools through subscription models and other revenue streams.

## Overview

The monetization module is organized into three main components:

1. **Subscription Models**: Classes for creating and managing different subscription models and pricing tiers
2. **Pricing Calculator**: Tools to calculate optimal pricing for your products
3. **Revenue Projector**: Tools to project revenue based on different scenarios

## Subscription Models

The `subscription_models.py` module provides classes for creating and managing different subscription models, including:

- `SubscriptionModel`: Base class for all subscription models
- `FreemiumModel`: Freemium model with a free tier and paid tiers

Each model includes methods for:

- Tier definitions
- Feature allocation
- Pricing structure
- Billing cycle options

## Pricing Calculator

The `pricing_calculator.py` module provides tools to calculate optimal pricing for your products, including:

- `PricingCalculator`: Base class for all pricing calculators
- Methods for calculating optimal prices based on different strategies
- Price sensitivity analysis tools

## Revenue Projector

The `revenue_projector.py` module provides tools to project revenue based on different scenarios, including:

- `RevenueProjector`: Class for projecting revenue for subscription-based products
- User acquisition projections
- Conversion rate projections
- Churn rate projections
- Lifetime value calculations
- Cash flow projections

## Usage

To use these tools, import the relevant modules and call the functions with your specific parameters.

Example:

```python
from monetization.subscription_models import FreemiumModel
from monetization.pricing_calculator import PricingCalculator
from monetization.revenue_projector import RevenueProjector

# Create a freemium subscription model
model = FreemiumModel(
    name="AI Tool Subscription",
    description="Subscription model for an AI-powered tool"
)

# Add features and tiers
feature1 = model.add_feature(
    name="Basic Feature",
    description="A basic feature"
)

model.add_feature_to_free_tier(feature1["id"])

pro_tier = model.add_paid_tier(
    name="Pro",
    description="Pro tier with advanced features",
    price_monthly=19.99
)

# Calculate optimal pricing
calculator = PricingCalculator(
    name="AI Tool Pricing Calculator",
    description="Pricing calculator for an AI-powered tool"
)

analysis = calculator.analyze_price_sensitivity(
    base_price=19.99,
    market_size=10000,
    price_elasticity=1.2
)

# Project revenue
projector = RevenueProjector(
    name="AI Tool Revenue Projector",
    description="Revenue projector for an AI-powered tool",
    initial_users=0,
    user_acquisition_rate=50,
    conversion_rate=0.2,
    churn_rate=0.05
)

projection = projector.project_revenue(
    subscription_model=model,
    prices={pro_tier["id"]: 19.99},
    months=36
)

print(f"3-year revenue projection: ${projection['total_revenue']:.2f}")
```

## Demo

Run the demo script to see the monetization tools in action:

```bash
python monetization_demo.py
```

## Testing

Run the test scripts to verify that the monetization tools are working correctly:

```bash
python test_subscription_model.py
python test_freemium_model.py
python test_pricing_calculator.py
python test_revenue_projector.py
```

## Customization

These tools are designed to be customized for your specific niche and solution. Look for comments marked with `TODO` for guidance on what to customize.

## Dependencies

The tools have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Standard library modules (json, math, datetime, uuid)

No external dependencies are required.
