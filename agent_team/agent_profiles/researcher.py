        Algorithm description:
        ---------------------
        The niche identification algorithm operates as follows:
        1. For each market segment in the input list:
           a. Call identify_niches_in_segment to get segment-specific niches
           b. Add these niches to the master list
        2. Sort all identified niches by opportunity score in descending order
           to prioritize the most promising opportunities
        3. Store the sorted list in the team's project state for workflow continuity
        4. Return the sorted list of niche opportunities

        This algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer approach by:
        - Breaking down the broad market analysis into segment-specific analyses
        - Aggregating the results
        - Applying a consistent ranking methodology across all niches

        Performance considerations:
        -------------------------
        - Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the total number of niches
          across all segments (dominated by the sorting operation)
        - Space complexity: O(n) to store all identified niches
