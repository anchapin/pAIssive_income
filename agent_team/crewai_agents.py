from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task

# Example: Define agent roles
data_gatherer = Agent(
    role="Data Gatherer",
    goal="Collect relevant information and data for the project",
    backstory="An AI specialized in data collection from APIs and databases.",
)

analyzer = Agent(
    role="Analyzer",
    goal="Analyze collected data and extract actionable insights",
    backstory="An AI expert in analytics and pattern recognition.",
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Generate clear, readable reports from analyzed data",
    backstory="An AI that excels at communicating insights in natural language.",
)

# Example: Define tasks
task_collect = Task(
    description="Gather all relevant data from internal and external sources.",
    agent=data_gatherer,
)
task_analyze = Task(
    description="Analyze gathered data for trends and anomalies.", agent=analyzer
)
task_report = Task(
    description="Write a summary report based on analysis.", agent=writer
)

# Example: Assemble into a Crew (team)
reporting_team = Crew(
    agents=[data_gatherer, analyzer, writer],
    tasks=[task_collect, task_analyze, task_report],
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import logging

    # Configure logging
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
    )

    # Create a module logger
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    # Example: Run the workflow (for demonstration; adapt as needed)
    reporting_team.run()
    logger.info("CrewAI reporting workflow completed.")

# Next steps:
# - Replace example agents, goals, and tasks with project-specific logic.
# - Integrate with application triggers or API endpoints as needed.
# - See agent_team/README.md (to be created) for setup and usage.
