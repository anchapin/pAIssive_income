#   pytest --noconftest
# or set --confcutdir=tests/ai_models/adapters accordingly.

    slow: mark test as slow (taking more than 1 second to run)

    webhook: mark test related to webhook functionality
    api: mark test related to API functionality
    payment: mark test related to payment functionality
    security: mark test related to security features
    model: mark test related to AI model functionality
    performance: mark test performance-sensitive test
