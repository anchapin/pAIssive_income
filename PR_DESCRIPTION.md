# Enhanced Environment Detection for CI and Docker Environments

## Overview

This PR enhances the environment detection system used in our frontend tests,
particularly focusing on improving compatibility with CI platforms and Docker environments. The changes integrate our unified environment detection module across the codebase to ensure consistent environment detection and handling.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Mock Path-to-RegExp Module

- Integrated the unified environment detection module into `enhanced_mock_path_to_regexp.js`
- Improved GitHub Actions detection using the unified module
- Enhanced Docker environment detection with more robust checks
- Added better error handling and logging for CI environments
- Fixed issues with path handling in different environments
- Added comprehensive environment information to log files and markers

### 2. CI Test Runner Improvements

- Updated `run_ci_tests_enhanced.js` to fully utilize the unified environment detection module
- Enhanced success markers with more detailed environment information
- Improved log file creation with unified environment detection data
- Added better error handling for CI-specific scenarios

### 3. Simple Test Spec Updates

- Integrated the unified environment detection module into `simple_test.spec.ts`
- Enhanced environment reporting with unified module information
- Improved fallback mechanisms when the unified module is not available
- Added comprehensive environment logging for better debugging

## Benefits

- **Consistent Environment Detection**: Uses the same detection logic across all test files
- **Improved CI Compatibility**: Better detection of GitHub Actions,
Jenkins,
GitLab CI,
and other CI platforms
- **Enhanced Docker Support**: More robust detection of Docker,
Kubernetes,
and other container environments
- **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error reporting and fallback mechanisms
- **Comprehensive Logging**: More detailed environment information for debugging

## Testing

The changes have been tested locally to ensure they work as expected. The environment detection correctly identifies the local environment and should properly detect CI and Docker environments when run in those contexts.

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more CI platforms to the unified environment detection module
- Enhance the Docker environment detection with more specific container types
- Add more comprehensive tests for different CI platforms

## Related Issues

This PR addresses issues with CI environment detection,
particularly in GitHub Actions workflows,
and improves the path-to-regexp mock implementation for better compatibility across different environments.
