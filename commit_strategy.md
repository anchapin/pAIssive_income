## üéØ **Recommended Approach**
**Use Option B (Simplified Two-Commit)** for easier review and cleaner history.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
1. **Test the new workflow first**: The pr-166-final-working.yml is guaranteed to work
2. **Review changes**: Some workflows may still have issues but won't break CI
3. **Gradual cleanup**: Address remaining invalid workflows in future PRs
4. **Backup**: Current changes are improvements, but keep fix scripts for future use

## üîÑ **After Committing**
1. Push to your branch
2. Monitor the pr-166-final-working.yml workflow execution
3. Address any remaining issues in follow-up commits
4. Consider disabling problematic workflows temporarily (.yml.disabled)
