DEV_WORKFLOW
---
description: Guide for using meta-development script (scripts/dev.js) to manage task-driven development workflows
globs: **/*
filesToApplyRule: **/*
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Development Workflow Process**
  - Follow test-driven development practices
  - Implement code following project standards and best practices
  - Verify functionality according to test strategies before marking as complete
  - Update documentation when implementation differs from original plan
  - Maintain clean code structure and proper error handling
  - Respect dependency chains and priorities when selecting work
  - Report progress regularly and document changes

- **Task Complexity Analysis**
  - Run `node scripts/dev.js analyze-complexity --research` for comprehensive analysis
  - Review complexity report in scripts/task-complexity-report.json
  - Or use `node scripts/dev.js complexity-report` for a formatted, readable version of the report
  - Focus on tasks with highest complexity scores (8-10) for detailed breakdown
  - Use analysis results to determine appropriate subtask allocation
  - Note that reports are automatically used by the expand command

- **Task Breakdown Process**
  - For tasks with complexity analysis, use `node scripts/dev.js expand --id=<id>`
  - Otherwise use `node scripts/dev.js expand --id=<id> --subtasks=<number>`
  - Add `--research` flag to leverage Perplexity AI for research-backed expansion
  - Use `--prompt="<context>"` to provide additional context when needed
  - Review and adjust generated subtasks as necessary
  - Use `--all` flag to expand multiple pending tasks at once
  - If subtasks need regeneration, clear them first with `clear-subtasks` command

- **Implementation Drift Handling**
  - When implementation differs significantly from planned approach
  - When future tasks need modification due to current implementation choices
  - When new dependencies or requirements emerge
  - Call `node scripts/dev.js update --from=<futureTaskId> --prompt="<explanation>"` to update tasks.json

- **Task Status Management**
  - Use 'pending' for tasks ready to be worked on
  - Use 'done' for completed and verified tasks
  - Use 'deferred' for postponed tasks
  - Add custom status values as needed for project-specific workflows

- **Task File Format Reference**
  ```
  # Task ID: <id>
  # Title: <title>
  # Status: <status>
  # Dependencies: <comma-separated list of dependency IDs>
  # Priority: <priority>
  # Description: <brief description>
  # Details:
  <detailed implementation notes>
  
  # Test Strategy:
  <verification approach>
  ```





- **Task Structure Fields**
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the task (Example: `1`)
  - **title**: Brief, descriptive title (Example: `"Initialize Repo"`)
  - **description**: Concise summary of what the task involves (Example: `"Create a new repository, set up initial structure."`)
  - **status**: Current state of the task (Example: `"pending"`, `"done"`, `"deferred"`)
  - **dependencies**: IDs of prerequisite tasks (Example: `[1, 2]`)
    - Dependencies are displayed with status indicators (✅ for completed, ⏱️ for pending)
    - This helps quickly identify which prerequisite tasks are blocking work
  - **priority**: Importance level (Example: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`)
  - **details**: In-depth implementation instructions (Example: `"Use GitHub client ID/secret, handle callback, set session token."`)
  - **testStrategy**: Verification approach (Example: `"Deploy and call endpoint to confirm 'Hello World' response."`)
  - **subtasks**: List of smaller, more specific tasks (Example: `[{"id": 1, "title": "Configure OAuth", ...}]`)

- **Environment Variables Configuration**
  - **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** (Required): Your Anthropic API key for Claude (Example: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...`)
  - **MODEL** (Default: `"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"`): Claude model to use (Example: `MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229`)
  - **MAX_TOKENS** (Default: `"4000"`): Maximum tokens for responses (Example: `MAX_TOKENS=8000`)
  - **TEMPERATURE** (Default: `"0.7"`): Temperature for model responses (Example: `TEMPERATURE=0.5`)
  - **DEBUG** (Default: `"false"`): Enable debug logging (Example: `DEBUG=true`)
  - **LOG_LEVEL** (Default: `"info"`): Console output level (Example: `LOG_LEVEL=debug`)
  - **DEFAULT_SUBTASKS** (Default: `"3"`): Default subtask count (Example: `DEFAULT_SUBTASKS=5`)
  - **DEFAULT_PRIORITY** (Default: `"medium"`): Default priority (Example: `DEFAULT_PRIORITY=high`)
  - **PROJECT_NAME** (Default: `"MCP SaaS MVP"`): Project name in metadata (Example: `PROJECT_NAME=My Awesome Project`)
  - **PROJECT_VERSION** (Default: `"1.0.0"`): Version in metadata (Example: `PROJECT_VERSION=2.1.0`)
  - **PERPLEXITY_API_KEY**: For research-backed features (Example: `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-...`)
  - **PERPLEXITY_MODEL** (Default: `"sonar-medium-online"`): Perplexity model (Example: `PERPLEXITY_MODEL=sonar-large-online`)

- **Determining the Next Task**
  - Identify tasks with all dependencies satisfied
  - Tasks should be prioritized by priority level, dependency count, and logical order
  - Consider comprehensive task information including:
    - Basic task details and description
    - Implementation details
    - Subtasks (if they exist)
    - Contextual requirements
  - Recommended before starting any new development work
  - Respect project's dependency structure
  - Ensure tasks are completed in the appropriate sequence
  - Plan ready-to-use approaches for common development actions

- **Viewing Specific Task Details**
  - Review specific tasks and their requirements in detail
  - Use clear identification for subtasks and their relationships
  - Display comprehensive information for each task
  - For parent tasks, show all subtasks and their current status
  - For subtasks, show parent task information and relationship
  - Provide contextual requirements appropriate for the specific task
  - Useful for examining task details before implementation or checking status

- **Managing Task Dependencies**
  - Add dependencies between tasks as needed
  - Remove dependencies when requirements change
  - Prevent circular dependencies and duplicate dependency entries
  - Check dependencies for existence before adding or removing
  - Update documentation after dependency changes
  - Visualize dependencies with status indicators in documentation



- **Code Analysis & Refactoring Techniques**
  - **Top-Level Function Search**
    - Use grep pattern matching to find all exported functions across the codebase
    - Command: `grep -E "export (function|const) \w+|function \w+\(|const \w+ = \(|module\.exports" --include="*.js" -r ./`
    - Benefits:
      - Quickly identify all public API functions without reading implementation details
      - Compare functions between files during refactoring (e.g., monolithic to modular structure)
      - Verify all expected functions exist in refactored modules
      - Identify duplicate functionality or naming conflicts
    - Usage examples:
      - When migrating from `scripts/dev.js` to modular structure: `grep -E "function \w+\(" scripts/dev.js`
      - Check function exports in a directory: `grep -E "export (function|const)" scripts/modules/`
      - Find potential naming conflicts: `grep -E "function (get|set|create|update)\w+\(" -r ./`
    - Variations:
      - Add `-n` flag to include line numbers
      - Add `--include="*.ts"` to filter by file extension
      - Use with `| sort` to alphabetize results
    - Integration with refactoring workflow:
      - Start by mapping all functions in the source file
      - Create target module files based on function grouping
      - Verify all functions were properly migrated
      - Check for any unintentional duplications or omissions

---
The below describes how you should be structuring new rule sections in this document.
- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **Section References:**
  - Use `ALL_CAPS_SECTION` to reference files
  - Example: `WINDSURF_RULES`

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**

  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules

description: Guidelines for continuously improving this rules document based on emerging code patterns and best practices.
globs: **/*
filesToApplyRule: **/*
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Rule Improvement Triggers:**
  - New code patterns not covered by existing rules
  - Repeated similar implementations across files
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented
  - New libraries or tools being used consistently
  - Emerging best practices in the codebase

- **Analysis Process:**
  - Compare new code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized
  - Look for references to external documentation
  - Check for consistent error handling patterns
  - Monitor test patterns and coverage

- **Rule Updates:**
  - **Add New Rules When:**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
    - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
    - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
    - New security or performance patterns emerge

  - **Modify Existing Rules When:**
    - Better examples exist in the codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered
    - Related rules have been updated
    - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**
  ```typescript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const data = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, email: true },
    where: { status: 'ACTIVE' }
  });
  
  // Consider adding a PRISMA section in the .windsurfrules:
  // - Standard select fields
  // - Common where conditions
  // - Performance optimization patterns
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Monitor code review comments
  - Track common development questions
  - Update rules after major refactors
  - Add links to relevant documentation
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Rule Deprecation:**
  - Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
  - Remove rules that no longer apply
  - Update references to deprecated rules
  - Document migration paths for old patterns

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep examples synchronized with code
  - Update references to external docs
  - Maintain links between related rules
  - Document breaking changes
